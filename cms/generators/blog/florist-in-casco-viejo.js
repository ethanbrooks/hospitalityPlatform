I enjoy Calle 12 a lot because it has several of those old trades: there is at least one shoe guy, two tailors and the florist.  The name of the shop is La Decorativa, and you can make your orders by email or cellphone. They have done several events for Hotel Ejecutivo, a corporate hotel out of Casco, including small corporate meetings and even weddings.  Contact them at: fdecorativas@hotmail.es  They speak Spanish only! but if you go there and point out what you need I`m sure they`ll figure it out.\n     \n",
