The movie showing was the Panamanian movie Salsipuedes, almost entirely shot in Casco Viejo (Yes, there were some airport shots we didn´t get! ). The story was well put together, and the casting included children from the neighborhood, incredible talent! I didn´t realize how incredibly diverse Casco was for a film maker: the beach, plazas, old buildings, new buildings, rural look, city look, you can cut and paste depending on what you want to achive.\nCongratulations, well done! here is the trailer: (there are English subtitles)\n\nFestival is still going on strong, so don´t forget to visit their site to see what´s next.\n   \n",
