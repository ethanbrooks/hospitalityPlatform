  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nI couldn´t believe it. I was in a line (and a long one!) to get into Teatro Amador. But it wasn´t the latest concert of the latest celebrity. We were all there to assist to TEDx Panama City, and the conversation was to be about culture and identity.\nWe had a blast. From the bizarre to the concrete, speakers brought a broad spectrum, but everything related to education, cultural manifestations, cultural projects, cultural reflections and meditations.  It closed with Panamanian saxophonist Yahaziel Arrocha playing his own interpretation of Suspiros de una Fea and with spoken poetry by the Congo community from Portobelo.\nI want to congratulate the team that made this possible, specially to Alfonso Grimaldo. Paraphrasing TED`s moto, I think these are passions worth spreading.\n   \n",
