Between the two you cover a big part of Panama`s cultural rainbow!\nWhile part of their production is at those communities, they also produce &#8220;in house&#8221;. Here is the info on each one:\nPapiro y Yo: located at 4th Street, betwen Central Avenue and B Avenue, entering by Casa Góngora or if you are at Plaza Bolivar entering by Casablanca.  Here is their FACEBOOK page. \n \nKaravan: located at 3rd Street and A Avenue, it is next to an easy landmark: the Arco Chato.  HERE is their website with contact info.\n  \n",
