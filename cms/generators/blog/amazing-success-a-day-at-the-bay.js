  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nLast Saturday, neighbors and members of Casco Viejo`s neighborhood association (AVACA) gathered at the Santo Domingo beach to have fun. Do beach-like things. Simply use it. And the result was nothing short of a historic event.  Remember my post about this beach being &#8220;alive&#8221; back in the 40`s? (here) this was way better!\nCheck it out! and you know what the best is? you don´t need a reason or an event to go.  This is a public beach, an incredible natural resource 15 minutes away from Panama`s modern city, just steps away from your door if you live in Casco.  Just remember: be respectful, no amplified noise nor licor&#8230; and take back with you any trash that you may produce.  This is a beautiful family style beach, let`s keep the love for it high.\nThanks to Sarah Tyler and Casco Antiguo Spanish School for this amazing video of that day. And to Nina Tissera for putting it together, and all the community and AVACA members who made it possible!\n\n// \n\nPost by Casco Antiguo Spanish School.\n\n&nbsp;\n       \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
