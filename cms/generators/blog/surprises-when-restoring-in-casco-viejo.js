The photos below are from the former St. George school in Casco Viejo, which was thought to be a building from the 50`s. While restoring, the owners discovered beautiful calicanto arches, way under the concrete layers. And now, at the very entrance, the original sign that reads: &#8220;Chaluja Alfonso&#8221;.\nI had no clue what this meant, until this past weekend when passing by with my father and his friends who grew up in Casco, they stopped and said: ah! Almacén Chaluja!.   Memories came back, stories started to flow, &#8221; do you remember when&#8230;?&#8221;.\nI know, I love this town.\n \n",
