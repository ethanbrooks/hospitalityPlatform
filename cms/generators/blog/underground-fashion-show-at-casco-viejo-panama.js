Last week, a fashion show was held at one of the largest fincas, along with a fashion flea market. The ambiance was fantastic, and the photography art show was excellent. Never thought I would finally see daring- straight forward-pretty-much-offensive- social criticism coming from a Panamanian, but it was great. Thumbs up for the organizers!!! got us thinking in different layers, and wanting more of these events in town.\n\n",
