Haven`t used them all, I think I still have 45 bottles or so. I think those I`ll use as daily gifts for my dog, as she loves to flatten them. At the end, I`ll send the entire package (flat bottles and tree) to the recycling company that has started to collect material in Casco Viejo.\nI call this an &#8220;ongoing&#8221; design&#8230; for sure it will be very different at the ends of the year!
