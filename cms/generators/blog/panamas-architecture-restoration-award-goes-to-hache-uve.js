  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo\nHache Uve, one of the main restoration firms in Casco Viejo just got awarded on the &#8220;Restoration&#8221; category by Panama`s Architects and Engineers Association (SPIA).\nThe &#8220;Premio Magno&#8221; was given for their work restoring Benedetti Hermanos, a Casco Viejo building from the 1920`s reflecting the Art Deco wave that made it into the colonial city and became part of its unique architectural eclecticism.  Many details from the original building were kept, sometimes even on its raw form to allow the building itself tell its story:  original stairs, glass elevator overlooking original bricks, the height of the apartments, and of course, the elegant facade which features a beautiful glass and wood commercial window which was rescued from historic photographs.\nHere are some historic photos of the building and how it looks today. The developer, Conservatorio S.A. , was recently awarded with the Global Vision Award (read more here) and together with Hache Uve is now restoring what will be a fifty room hotel (American Trade Hotel) with an events space right in front.\nCongratulations! Keep up the good work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n",
