Explore the mangroves and take a look at all the small circle of life that happens there every day.  To look at things the same you did as a child: every small detail becomes a world on its own. Build a sand castle. A sculpture to defy the tides. Throw a Frisbee to your dog. Paddle. Catch a wave.\nAll of this is possible at Casco Viejo`s beaches. And to celebrate it, Casco`s neighbors have decided to show up at the beach at Calle 3era and A Avenue to simply&#8230; use it. As a beach. To re discover it, and invite others to re discover it with them.\nIt is being called &#8220;A Day at the Bay&#8221;, and it will have several events happening on January 31st,. 7 a.m. with yoga at the sand bar, soccer leagues around 2 p.m.  There will be paddle boarding. We`ll get the schedule later this week, so keep tuned.  But the most important thing is just to show up and use the beach however you want to use it. It is public, it is yours. So come and join!\nMeeting point: Beach at Calle 3era and 4ta, Casco Viejo. You can enter by Mostaza`s street or the one after, by Santa Familia.\n#undiaenlabahia #adayatthebay INSTAGRAM @UNDIAENLABAHIA\n\n",
