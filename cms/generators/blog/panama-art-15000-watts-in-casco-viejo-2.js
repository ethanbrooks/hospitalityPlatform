  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Antiguo\nCasco Viejo, Plaza Herrera\n\nLast night I went to the opening of the show &#8220;15000 Watts&#8221; at La Casona de Brujas\nin Plaza Herrera.&nbsp; The show is a meditation on the current energy crisis, in\nPanama, in the world, and how it touches all of us at different levels.\nIt combined photos and paintings from both artist Miguel Lombardo and Cartooch. Miguel,\nin a more dramatic tone and Cartooch using their children-like style, it was a good\ncombination on such a serious issue.&nbsp; Most of the pieces by Cartooch had buttons\nto &#8220;turn on&#8221; the lights which iluminated brains, eyes and heart.\nThere was also a piece on bringing awareness to natural spaces through the use of\nimpossible to miss orange cubes. This experiment started a while ago, I remember driving\nthrough Balboa Avenue and pam! suddenly these big orange cubes glowing at night, or\n&#8220;just hanging out&#8221; there during the day. I said to myself&#8230; what is this??? Then\nI met Miguel and he explained how the intention was to focus the attention on the\nbits of nature we take for granted within the city. Later on he did it in one of Casco´s\nbeaches, and from there on to other places.\nAnother big piece was made out of photographs of the areas where the energy companies\nhave projects to build dams and hydroelectric plants. Most of these areas are inhabited\nby indians, so it becomes more of a social issue. On one hand, Panama´s electricity\nis not only becoming very expensive but also scarce. We have the Canal resources to\nbring hydro electricity and some other plants, but we are growing as a nation, so\nelectricity becomes a big issue. Panamanians are experiencing the raise of the cost\nof energy and claim for more plants, which are only feasable in a couple of places.\nWithout the proper integration of the communities to these very necessary projects\na huge missunderstanding is caused.&nbsp; I can see myself in both sides: we need\nenergy and cheaper. They want to stay in the land they´ve been for some years. It\nis the dynamic tension of our world today.\nWhat about solar? studies say that there is not enough sunlinght in Panama to feed\nthe city, just 5 months a year, maybe. What about winds? we have winds, but not enough.\nAnd so the list goes. In the meanwhile, costs raise and availability diminishes.\nThe other big issue is efficiency of lines. So many times the government isn´t able\nto repair and organize the cables in the right way.\nBack in a corner, there is a very special box. It is, for me, the most important one.\nA question is written on the wall: &#8220;Should we keep allowing this?&#8221;&nbsp; It is our\ncall to action.\nThe problems were identified a long time ago, but it is only through our actions that\nwe can provoke change.\nWhat am I going to do about this?\nTwo boxes are provided, one with a yes and another one with a no, and papers so you\ncan provide your input.&nbsp;&nbsp; But is that enough?\nAs I´ve come to learn about our recent experiment on the Urban Composter Contest,\nmost of us feel we don´t have the time to take action. We would love to, and we get\noutraged with the energy crisis or the huge expenses of resources.&nbsp;\nBut are we really able to get out of our comfort zone and do something about it?\nhumm&#8230;&#8230;.\n\n\n\n\n",
