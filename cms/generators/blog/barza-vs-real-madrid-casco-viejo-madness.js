  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nI really can´t tell why. Why do we care so very much about either Barza or the Real Madrid. I mean, after all, we are in Panama. Is it because we were a Spanish colony? don´t think so.  But we love them, and depending on which street you are in Casco Viejo you are either a Barza fan or a Real Madrid addict.\nWe were peacefully sitting at our Arco office, which happens to be steps away from a sports bar. At some point we heard this incredible screaming, like a pack of howler monkeys and then a lot of laughter.  I went out to see what was going on, people spilling from inside the place to the street, each one with a theory of what was happening.  The center of the dispute was that the game was still tied after quite a while, nobody could believe it.  And when it ended up tied, people where screaming even higher!!!\nI don´t know if the Barza or the Real Madrid are aware of the crazy fans they have here.  Someone please send them this blog!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
