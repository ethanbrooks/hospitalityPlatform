At its birth one year ago, the community identified five focus areas, being\nthe garbage disposal one of them. Since then, the association has done different activities\n(from beach cleaning to educational workshops), many of them side by side with local\nauthorities. However, the recollection system in the neighborhood was working only\nhalf way.\nTomorrow, AVACA`s Garbage Committee, the City (Municipio), along with Oficina del\nCasco Antiguo and the support of local politician José Blandón will inaugurate a new\nrecollection system for the area. It is a first time for the neighborhood, as historically\ncitizens and government had lived and worked in different spheres. But through AVACA,\nCasco`s community has been able to get organized and slowly lobby towards their goals,\nwhich is a very unique situation within Panama City. Only a handful of neighborhoods\nhave organized, working associations.  Success depends completely on a full collaboration\nof both parties and continuity.\nFor Casco Antiguo, the first step has been to include local schools into the process.\nOn Thursday, three schools will receive awards for a small art contest where children\npresented drawings of their vision for a clean Casco Viejo.  The winner drawing\nwill be used as part of the campaign, which will include signs along the recollection\ntrucks and fliers.\nThe event will also have a small theatre play where clowns and mimes will get the\npoint across using what Panamanians and children love best: laughs.\nThe new recollection system will be simple: garbage will be collected at night.\nFrom 10 p.m. to 9 a.m. residential garbage, and then from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. a special\ncar will come for commercial and restaurants. Garbage will be outside each building,\nand the use of bags is mandatory.\nAs simple as this sounds, it is a radical cultural change for the neighborhood, used\nto dispose garbage in any bag (and only if applicable) and at any hour. Education\nwill be key to achieve this goal and for the next two weeks members of AVACA and Municipio\nwill walk the area talking to every resident and handling educational material.\nAnother important element of the program is the coordination with local authorities\nto fine those who don`t comply with the new regulation. The Corregiduría will be able\nto process all the phone calls regarding improperly disposed garbage.\n&#8220;We know this is the beginning and we`ll need probably to make adjustments as we verify\nexecution, but we can make of Casco Antiguo a roll model neighborhood. It is a small\nsite, and we are excited about getting this project started.&#8221; said Eudes Quijada,\narea supervisor for Panama`s Garbage Department (DIMAUD).\nSome of the local restaurants have started to recycle, which makes for an interesting\nsecond phase of the project.\n\n\n",
