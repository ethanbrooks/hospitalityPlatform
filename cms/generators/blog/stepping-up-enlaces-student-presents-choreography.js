  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nTo dance, is one thing. To create, another.  To direct your own peers takes a special skill. Now try to do all of it, and, by the way, you are barely a teenager.\nYesterday, we went to Enlaces dance program, to see the first choreography fully created, directed and danced by the students. Several pieces woven into one concept: what it is to be born in a place/circumstance vs another.  The result was fantastic, in a world where it seems we don´t find the correct words to talk about our difference, these kids found it almost easy to show us with simple honesty how they see it and feel it through movement.\nCongratulations to the whole Enlaces team, and above all kudos to the young choreographers and dancers! sorry for my amateur video, hope you like them.
