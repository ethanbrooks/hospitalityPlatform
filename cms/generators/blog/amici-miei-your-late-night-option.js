From there we went to the also newly opened El Social, a beer garden just next door. By the time we were finished there we were hungry again. This would have normally be a problem in Casco, but not anymore! Amici Miei to the rescue. Really nice pizza, pasta and salads, they are open until late and located exactly at the right spot: next to La Concordia hotel, on Ave Central and 11th street (by the traffic light). We ordered a personal pizza ($3.50!) with arugula. And the margheritta was exactly what I needed at that hour. They are open for lunch too.\n  \n",
