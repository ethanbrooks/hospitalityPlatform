  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Antiguo, Casco Viejo\nFor some years now, Casco`s neighborhood association AVACA has been actively working on recycling in Casco.  It has a recycling program called Casco Recicla, which picks up material from residents and businesses every Wednesday.  It also coordinates beach cleanings per month and does educational events.\nThis Christmas, AVACA joined hands with the children`s program APROJUSAN and the social reintegration program Esperanza  from Fundacion Calicanto to do a fun activity: create Christmas trees out of plastic bottles picked from the beach or from Casco Recicla.\nYesterday, aided by Fundacion Eco Creando, all of them worked together into creating the first tree. This tree will be exhibited at 4th Street, and the Esperanza students will replicate what they`ve learned into a second tree for the street where they live by Calle 9na.  The goal is to have a total of 3 trees, the third one towards Plaza Herrera by calle 12.\nEach tree requires each team to: pick up recycling material from the street or beach, clean it up, prepare and team work until done. It is a beautiful small project with long lasting teachings and great message. Each tree will be in place until January 6th, and hopefully visited and photographed by everyone in the community or visiting!\nHere are the photos of the &#8220;making&#8221; of Tree One. Still not finished, so keep tuned!\n       \n&nbsp;\n",
