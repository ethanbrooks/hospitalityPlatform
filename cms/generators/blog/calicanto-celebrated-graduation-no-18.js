  "blog_article": "Casco Viejo, Panama\nYesterday, at the Canal Museum in Casco Antiguo, Fundacion Calicanto celebrated the 18th graduation of their CAPTA program.  This program prepares women from the neighborhood to work as house keepers in hotels, but it actually gives them much more:  the full cycle includes self esteem modules that help them effectively break the cycle of poverty.  From personal finances to emotional intelligence,  it lights a small flame of hope that now can grow with them and extend to their families.\nEach graduation has 20 women, which means the program has transformed the lives of 360 families.  Thanks to all the donors and to the people in Calicanto that makes it happen.   If you wish to learn more about the foundation, donate or volunteer,  check them out HERE. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
