Entrepreneurs have taken notice, as three new restaurants opened in Casco, two of them focused on fish and seafood. This week I`ll be writing about them all, today starting with Finca del Mar (The Sea`s Farm).\nIt is located at Calle 2da, by the French Embassy and it is owned and run by a French team.  After spending some days in the Basque coast of France, I`m really looking forward to try their food. The place looks really nice, the open terrace and gardens have a chill ambiance.\nThey will be opened from 8 a.m. until late at night, so they will be offering breakfast!  Here is their celphone for more info and reservations 6744-6223\n \n",
