  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\n&nbsp;\nThis past weekend, Casco Viejo´s kinder had a beautiful bazar. The purpose was to fundraise for the scholarship program that will allow children from Casco´s community to attend. This school is a Montessori school and we are so proud of it. Has grown little by little, literally from the houses of parents who believed in educating their children in a different way and in Casco´s environment. Now, they have a small building, with different classrooms, and a dedicated group of teachers.  The day was awesome. Everyone came to support, and old friends met new friends!\nIf you are interested in the school, please contact Keren Levanon at: 6444-7452\n  \n",
