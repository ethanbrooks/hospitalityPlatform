Cafe Vienna just opened for the delight of Casco Viejo residents and visitors.  I frankly could not recognize Arco Properties old office at Calle 1era and A Avenue, turned into this lovely cafe.  Kept looking for where my old desk used to be, but got distracted by the honey and almond pastries. I know, I have a sweet tooth. It is terrible. But it is so good&#8230;.\nGerman owners Tina and Anuschka (mother and daughter) live above, so breakfast will be their specialty. It is also a great place to get your evening started, if you want to have a drink before going to the National Theatre (perfect for tomorrow! with La Traviata`s debut) or just to meet with friends before dinner (probably next door, at Callejon del Gato, owned by Sajoscha, Tina`s son).\nContact them at: 211-2513  info@elcafevienna.com\nWillkommen in Casco Viejo!!!\n\n",
