When I started in this business I had tons of trouble myself, imagining spaces and sizes so I could relate to her struggle. I am a very visual person myself. So I came up with: “let´s just draw it in the sand” idea, since the beach is literally one block away from Arco Properties office.\nSo we went there, armed with a measuring tape and a stick.  We spent maybe ten minutes on it. The results were super fun, I mean, our wall lines could only had been described as “free flowing art” and &#8220;well intentioned&#8221;, but somehow we got the general idea. Now that I think of it, it kind of looked like a Barbapapa house. If you don´t know what I´m talking about, click HERE. \nI was feeling so proud. Then a second opportunity came, when friends of ours were having trouble imagining the rooms of another place. I said, “hey, why don´t you draw it at the beach, I just did it the other day and was fun”.   As those internet cliffhanger posts say “we were not prepared for what happened next”.\nThe photos they sent me were absolutely amazing: a perfectly drawn apartment on the sand: kitchen, bedroom, living room, everything to detail and scale. It could not be any more perfect, not even with real furniture. I couldn´t come out of my shock, I had to know how they did it.  Their response was equally wonderful and simple, all you need is: “1 measuring tape, a stick and Pythagoras method”.\nI guess I was short of one item from that list!\n \n",
