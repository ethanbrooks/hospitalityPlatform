  "blog_article": "For such a small country, Panama is suddenly surrounded by heavy players. On one hand, the Panama Canal expansion project will cost over $5 billion dollars, and on the other hand, big guys such as Hewlett &#8211; Packard, Caterpillar, the Swiss Sanofi- Aventis, Procter &amp; Gamble and Sinope from China have either expressed their interest of moving headquarters here or are actually doing so.\nPanama has always benefit from its strategic location but for such a small country and considering the volume of business these group of companies bring together or individually to the table this will have a huge positive repercussion.\nSuddenly, airlines that had left the country before such as KLM are flying back to Panama again, re opening direct flights to Amsterdam. Banesco, the Venezuelan bank, has recently jumped into the Panamanian pool, probably looking for safer waters.\nNow, what does all this has to do with Casco Antiguo?\n\n\nIt so happens that most of these companies are basing in the former Canal  Zone, which is 5 minutes away from Casco Antiguo! Casco Viejo suddenly becomes a wonderful choice for future employees and executives to live in.  \n \nA central point between their jobs and modern Panama, they can have it all within a few minutes. It is extremely easy to go back and forth to the Canal Zone, we do it often to go jogging at the Causeway, Administration Building (great “steps” workout!) or to run to the top of Ancon Hill.  Back “home” they would have a handful of good lifestyle choices, since some of the best restaurants, café’s, bars and theatres are based in Casco.\n \n  Location, location, location!!!  \nWant to learn more about Casco Viejo?  go to www.arcoproperties.com\n",
