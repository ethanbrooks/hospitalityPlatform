  "blog_article": "\nPart of the lifestyle we enjoy in Casco Antiguo has to do with services that don’t break the bank.  When the owner of Chateau de Klippers returned to the USA, many of felt a void because it meant driving into the city instead of walking to Calle 9.  I finally  located three of the people from Klippers and decided to invite a few Casqueños over for a Spa Night. It was such fun. Mario cut our hair while Olga worked non-stop on five sets of fingers and toes.  Meanwhile, Isaac was upstairs giving massages.  So, when it’s time for a bit of pampering, think about throwing your own Spa Night.\n\nPS: Last week, a client desperately needed her hair to be done. Mario, even on short notice was able to accommodate. \nHere’s their contact information:  \nHair \nMario/6655-2317 \nManicure &amp; Pedicures \n Olga/6717-6142 \nMassage \nIsaac/6769-7682 \n \n  \nClara Keyes Hardin\n  \n\n\n\n\n",
