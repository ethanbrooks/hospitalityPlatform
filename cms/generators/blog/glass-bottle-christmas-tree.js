  "blog_article": "Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo\nTwo years ago, I started shifting from the traditional Christmas tree to ones made with recycled materials. The first year I made one with newspapers and miscellaneous stuff I found at the beach.  The second year, the theme was plastic bottles, also found at the beach. I used about 80 bottles or so on that one. Check out both photos HERE. This year, I thought it would be cool to do one with glass bottles, as glass looks always so elegant.\nLuckily for me, I live in front of Di Vino, a wine bar in Casco Viejo who handles all of their glass to Casco`s recycling center (on the other side of the street).  So all I had to do was to go there with a big bag and seat for 30 minutes and sort glass bottles out.  I`ve always been attracted to bottles, I have some old bottles from the Canal days and others that have weird or beautiful shapes. For my tree, I went with Perrier and Evian Pure bottles, because I liked their small and round shape.  I didn´t want the tree to be huge because of fear of my dog knocking it out.\nSo here it is! a work in progress&#8230; but looking quite good!\n\n\n\n\n",
