  "blog_article": "\nBack in 1998 things where quite different in Casco Viejo. It was more Viejo than Casco. It was a fragile, run down, un protected site most people in Panama (government and not) had &#8220;written off&#8221;.  Back then, a group of passionate profesionals stood up and basically made it happen: brought the attention of UNESCO and worked until this endangered species was protected for life.\nOne of the most important axis of this petition was Fundacion Calicanto. For years, they worked very hard to propose a law to protect these wonderful buildings, creating the foundations for all the appreciation we see today.\nSome years have passed and with the buildings protected, Calicanto has changed its focus towards the human patrimony of the Casco Antiguo. They have great programs we can all be part of. From trainning women in hotel skills to art courses for children and urban agriculture, their goal is to attack the roots of poverty through providing tools to the local population that will enable them to be part of the growth of their own neighborhood, and through this, revitalize themselves.\nOur Casco Viejo is so small and helping is so easy. Making a real difference takes very little. We welcome you to join the Foundation and be part of their programs. You can volunteer time or resources&#8230; or both!\nTo contact Heriberto Trejos (Calicanto´s Director) , just write to: fcalicanto@gmail.com\nTo learn more about Casco Viejo, don´t forget to visit us at: www.arcoproperties.com .  Our company donates every year 10% of its income to charity in Casco Viejo, most of it to Fundacion Calicanto. Buying through Arco Properties truly makes a difference. \n \n \n",
