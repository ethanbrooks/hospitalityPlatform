  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nOne of my favorite churches in Casco Viejo, the San Felipe Neri church is open (finally!) to the public.  From 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. you`ll be able to go in and experience the beauty of its intimate ambiance.  Built in 1688 it has so far 325 years. Take a look at the altar, but specially the chorus at the back of the church. Each part of this church has a story to tell,  specially those buried inside (so be careful where you step!).  Graves dating from 1850`s and probably before, people who lived through so many changes.\nEvery time I visit this church it reminds me of how quickly and dramatically the world has changed, from charcoal to electricity, from smoke to penicillin, from imperialism to democracy. But somehow there is a sense of stillness when you stand there, in its humble quietness.\nEnjoy!\n     \n",
