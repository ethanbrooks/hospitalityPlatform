Standing ovation!\nAfter such a fantastic performance, we went straight to Las Clementinas, I had a craving for their &#8220;guacho de mariscos&#8221; which is a very nice risotto with tomato and seafood sauce.  Lime and home made picante for those who like it spicy! for me, tons of lime!\nOut of the blue, Carlos, the manager of the restaurant, sat down at the restaurant`s piano and started playing beautifully! I think his favorite is Schumann, he really played it with a heart!\nSmall and big surprises&#8230; nowhere else but in Casco Viejo!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n",
