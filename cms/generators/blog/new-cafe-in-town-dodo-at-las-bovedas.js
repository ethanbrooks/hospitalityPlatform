It is almost like the café equivalent of a secret garden, you have to dock in order to get in, but once you are there it is charming as it can be.\nRun by Marcela Lombardo, Miguel`s mom, she defines it as a place for light food: salads, sandwiches and desserts. But I already got feedback from some of Dodo`s first clients and they tell me they have excellent coffee and that vegetarian options (and vegan!) are on the way.\nAnother nice thing to know about Dodò is that they are open for breakfast: 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Closed on Mondays, open the rest of the week.\nThumbs up!\n   \n",
