  "blog_article": "Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo, Panama\nReal Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic District\n&nbsp;\nWeekend is here! Thursday, Friday and Saturday tend to be the more active nights in Casco Viejo. Yesterday, Di Vino hosted a wine tasting while today Los Del Patio will have a small event featuring Seth Pettersen.  Platea will have their usual salsa night, followed by rock n roll (tomorrow).\nLa Vecindad, Mojitos Sin Mojitos and La Casona will be great spots to pass by and grab a beer with your friends.  If you are looking for a local dinner probably Bohemios or Cedros could be your choice. Plaza Bolivar will lighten up with its selection of Peruvian cuisine, ceviche, Italian and Sushi.\nBut if you want a romantic early start (always a good thing to impress the girls) don´t miss Las Clementinas gardens or cafe either for dinner or an early cocktail. Ask for their basil martini!\n\n",
