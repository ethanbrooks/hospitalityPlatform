It`s membership is as diverse as Casco itself, with people from Panama and all over the world.  And its work is equally diverse: from the beautiful garbage tanks painted by local artists,  street and beach cleaning to educational campaigns at schools and government lobby, this group is hardcore and passionate about Casco Viejo.\nIt is not uncommon to see AVACA working together with other ngo`s like Sembrarte, Fundación Calicanto, Jardines Urbanos, Generation Peace Academy, among others.  They use sinergy wherever it is found to lift the bar and show how simple things can make a world of difference.\nHere is part of the presentation given during its third year anniversary celebration.  If you wish to join, contact  director@avaca.org.pa  or send Arco an email and we`ll make sure to connect you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
