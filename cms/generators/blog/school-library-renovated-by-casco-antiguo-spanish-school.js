  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Antiguo, Casco Viejo\n&nbsp;\nA school library might seem something most take for granted, but for most public schools in Panama it is a challenge to keep up looking fresh and with new material (hopefully in two languages!). That is why we were super excited to be invited by Casco Antiguo´s Spanish School to the inauguration of the newly refurbished library at the Escuela de México. Casco´s Spanish School took the initiative along with their students, parents of Escuela de México and teachers to re paint and make the library more functional. Children were smiling, all happy to see the old space with a new face and new books!\nNow that it is done, if you have books you would like to donate, you can bring them to Casco´s Spanish School at A Avenue and 5th street, and they´ll make sure to take them to the school.\nCongratulations to everyone who made this possible, I don´t know the name of everyone involved, specially the donor who made a wonderful &#8220;Spanglish&#8221; speech! Thanks to David to make it happen and for the invitation to be there at the inauguration.\n  \n",
