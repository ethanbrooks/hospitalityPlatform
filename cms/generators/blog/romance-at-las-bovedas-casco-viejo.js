But somehow, in the middle of the hurricane, I came across this couple who was taking photos for their wedding. An entire entourage around them between photographers and friends (taking care of the dress).  Casco Viejo seems to be irresistible for romance. The beautiful marine landscape, the breeze, the park, the birds and children playing. No noise from traffic, no smog, somehow the city manages to fade out and people can unwind and smile.\n[slideshow]\n&nbsp;\n",
