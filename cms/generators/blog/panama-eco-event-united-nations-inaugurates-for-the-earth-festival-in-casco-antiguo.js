  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo &#8211; Casco Antiguo, San Felipe\nLast night, the United Nations Environmental Programee inaugurated at the National Theatre in Casco Antiguo their &#8220;For the Earth&#8221; Festival. It will last a month, with several activities within Casco Antiguo, ranging from poetry to rock concerts. Most of the activities will be held at the Anita Villalaz Theatre.\nHere are some pictures of the inauguration reception. It started with a concert by Panama´s National Orquestra and ended with a cocktail at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs located at the lovely Plaza Bolivar. It is an amazing building. I was glad to see a full house last night, and familiar faces from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (Juan Maté got awarded for his research in Panama, congratulations!) and other environmental NGO´s.\nTonight they´ll be inaugurating an art gallery in Las Bovedas, next to the Ministry of Culture. This gallery will host workshops about art and recycling during the festival for children. \n\n",
