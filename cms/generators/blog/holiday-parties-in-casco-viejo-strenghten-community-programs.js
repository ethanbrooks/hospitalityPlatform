  "blog_article": "Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo\n&nbsp;\nHolidays are basically here, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year&#8230; tons of things going on, and Casco Viejo isn´t the exception. However, many of the events held during this season in Casco Viejo are aimed to help the community, by either fundraising for a local ngo o directly doing something with the neighbors.\nThe first event of the season is really Thanksgiving, at the ends of November. This party is organized by members of AVACA, Casco Viejo`s Neighbors and Friends Association. It is a place to meet other neighbors and share wonderful food and wine. Every year, the party change places, normally featuring a new business, so that everyone gets to know it and welcome it.\nFor those of you who are living in Casco Viejo but are not yet part of AVACA, this would be a great opportunity to meet new people and learn about their programs. Joining is easy and their projects are fun. If you would like to go, please email us at: clara@arcoproperties.com  and save the date: November 24th.\nFor Christmas, there are all sorts of small and big initiatives.  But this year, the CanadaPLUS club is starting a &#8220;Candlelight Carol&#8221; that promises to grow year after year. All proceeds will go to Fundación Calicanto, a local ngo that works with women and children from the area.\nThe event will be absolutely delightful: an open air concert at Plaza Francia (Las Bovedas) with music by different choruses and the participation of the musicians from the Danilo Perez Foundation.  The event is on December 3rd, and will start at Plaza Catedral, where a procession of children carrying candles will walk all the way to Las Bovedas. And there, around 7 p.m. the concert will start.\nFor this event, there will be candles for sale, and you can reserve a good spot at the plaza (with a chair). Remember, all the proceeds go to Calicanto, so if you are thinking on coming, bring your family and friends!  For more information on this event, call David at 6689-6890 or email at clubcanadaplus@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
