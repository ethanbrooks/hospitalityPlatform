  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nPeople keep opening spaces to art in Casco Viejo, this time by Miguel Lombardo, right on top of Dodo at Las Bovedas in Plaza Francia. Welcome &#8220;Casasola&#8221;!\nThe space is featuring right now two art projects, one called &#8220;Ferretería Internacional&#8221; and the other one re creates an old style pharmacy. For Ferretería, the artist took furniture from an old hardware store and re created furniture almost like a sculpture. The specific hardware store he was re creating actually existed, and he got original pieces from the family who still owned a bunch of stuff. The result is beautiful, it makes you feel like a kid in a candy store: wanting to touch everything.\nLikewise, the &#8220;pharmacy&#8221; section also re created this type of store which back in the 20`s could very well sell you a cough remedy next to gun powder and lace. Miguel got the accounting books, which are in themselves pieces of art: you can almost trace the love put by the accountant in tracing every word and number. No one writes like that anymore! not one mistake, each line clean and clear.\nTo visit the space and get a tour of the pieces, please contact Miguel at 228-9105.
