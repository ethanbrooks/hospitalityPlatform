  "blog_article": "Panamá, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nThis past Sunday, the Municipality started a program that turns a portion of Avenida Central into a pedestrian street.  From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. , starting at Plaza Santa Ana and until the parking next to the National Theater, this street will be car free.\nCars will still be allowed into Casco, as a matter of fact, no changes will be made on how you enter or exit, other than you can´t access Central Avenue. Parking at the National Theater and behind Plaza Herrera will be available, as well as public transportation from the Cinta Costera into Casco, for those who want to leave the car outside and save the stress.\nThis event will be repeated every Sunday, a perfect moment to come with the family and enjoy Casco Viejo&#8230; walking!\n \nFranz put the monkey and frog out&#8230; just to see what people did. Tons of selfies!  and scared dogs&#8230; didn´t know what to make of the frog. Jajajaja! Chispa didn´t even pay attention.\n  \n",
