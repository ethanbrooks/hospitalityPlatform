Hotel Casco Antiguo.\nYou might have known it as Hotel Colon, one of the oldest and probably the only hotel in Panama that has been operating non stop since the 50`s.  New administration and new approach,  the hotel has been remodeled into a comfortable budget hotel with unexpected water views.\nThe hotel has been renamed Hotel Casco Antiguo, which fits more its historic character. You might not notice it from the outside, but inside you`ll discover a Marrakesh style lobby (original) and the beautiful carved wood ceiling at the second level which are quite a trip to Panama`s past, when the country catched up with having chic &#8220;chinese style rooms&#8221; and arabian style tiles (basically the 30`s).  Casco`s only original elevator (still working!!!) is here!!! with only one big handle that either goes up or down (the type of elevator that has iron gate and brass).\nRoom prices:  $17 (single room, shared bath), $20 (single room, private bath), $17 (Double room, shared bath), $24 double room private bath), $47 (double room/ private bath, air conditioning, hot water).\nThe fee includes breakfast and WiFi.
