  "blog_article": "Casco Viejo &#8211; Panama &#8211; Casco Antiguo\nReal Estate at Panama`s Historic District\nCan`t believe it: the Panama Jazz Festival`s gala is tomorrow night at Casco Viejo.  The big concert, which we look forward every year, will be on Saturday.   It is something special to see the Casco vibrating to good feeling and music. People walk around, sit around, chat, laugh and dance.   And while everything is normally well organized, the one thing that could throw your mood off is trying to drive into Casco Viejo.\nWhile every year, the festival has organized free transportation from Cinta Costera, this year the bus will leave from Multicentro (note! not Multiplaza) in Paitilla.  Multicentro Mall has about 3000 parking spaces. Ten buses will be available, taking people back and forth for free. They`ll work from 10 a.m. till 10 p.m. (and probably later). And if you would like to just &#8220;walk back&#8221; to your car, then the walk is only 20 minutes using the Cinta Costera!\nStickers will be provided to residents and business owners/ employees. This is coordinated by the Oficina del Casco Antiguo, so if you live or work in Casco be sure to get your sticker on time.\n",
