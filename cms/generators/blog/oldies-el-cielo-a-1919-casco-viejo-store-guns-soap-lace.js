This ad was found in a 1919 magazine, I have to say it is one of my favorites. Stores back then sold everything&#8230; at the same place and under the same counter. Items like &#8220;soap&#8221; were written in BIG BOLD LETTERS, as they were luxury items. Medicines were labeled (hum&#8230; were they labeled?) basically &#8220;drugs&#8221;, and claims of them curing anything would be based on the reputation of whomever sold that jar with pungent dark liquid in it to you.\n&#8220;El Cielo&#8221;, or &#8220;The Heaven&#8221; listed the items that made it famous or popular. Included, and I`m sure not limited to: rifles, guns, buttons, lace, ladies stalkings, sewing machines, lace, handkerchiefs and shoe soles. Please note that in big bold letters it says: MATA BICHOS (bug killer) and SOAP. Hey, we might have been a rough town, but at least we smelled good!\n\n&nbsp;\n",
