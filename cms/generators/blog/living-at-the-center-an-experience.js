  "blog_article": "Panamá, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nTraffic today is a main concern for everyone. Even though the Metro has improved the situation a lot, and the bus lines are far better now, it continues to be a critical factor for those who commute hours to and from home. Add normal errands like food and medicine, or just stuff that makes your life better like going out with friends, going to the theater or movies, you realize your quality of life has to come hand in hand with living the closest possible to the city center.\nThis is one of the many reasons we love the revitalization that is happening at the historic side of Santa Ana, specially by Grupo Conservatorio with their developments: Casa Patterson, La Manzana and Casa Balcones. Aimed to those looking to buy their first home, it offers units starting at $80,000, with one and two bedrooms, bathroom and balcony.  Steps away from everything: supermarket, stores, pool, plazas and all the cultural movement that Casco is known for. And yes, Santa Ana is part of Casco! and therefore elegible for Casco´s incentive´s law 136.\nCasa Patterson is under construction and delivering at the ends of this year. Casa Balcones and La Manzana are already on pre sales. If you are interested in living in the city center, let us know! We are also learning from our clients experiences, and taking statistics on how living close to the center saves them time, money and improves their lives.  If you have a story you would like to share, please send it to patrizia@arcoproperties.com\n&nbsp;\n\n",
