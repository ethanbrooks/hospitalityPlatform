  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nNothing like art and culture to open a dialogue and change society.  The current initiative by Panama´s Chapter of International Transparency paralel to the current International Anti Corruption Conference being held is simply genius (and of course we love it is happening in Casco´s plazas, so full of symbolism and open for free to everyone).\nStarted November 29th and will continue until the 4th of December, mainly showing at Plaza Catedral, but the 3rd at Plaza Francia. 6:30 p.m.  Each night, a different movie, from Panama, Mexico and so many others, all with the same running theme, different angles. Each one an excellent piece.  I caught the one about the Dietilene Glycol case and it was painful, but also a story of courage and love.\nMore about the conference HERE\nMore on the films HERE\nHere are the movies being shown:\n \n",
