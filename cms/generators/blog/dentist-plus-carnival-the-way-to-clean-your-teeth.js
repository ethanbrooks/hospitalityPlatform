When she told me how much she paid to get hers cleanned and/ or worked out I almost freaked &#8230; girl! you could be partying in Panama all through carnival with that kind of money!\nThis afternoon I´m visiting my dentist, which I´m proud to say is the only top of the line expense I have in my life. Well, the other one is my dog, I´ll do anything for my Chispa. And my husband. Humm&#8230; now that I think about it, I do have quite some expenses! no disclosure on who comes in first&#8230;\nBut seriously, cleaning my teeth with a US trainned Panamanian top on his career dentist is $60.  For fixing her teeth which had a hairline crack with great care was something close to $350.  In the States, she commented, this would be easily $1500. Maybe a $1000 since she could bargain a bit.  This equals some serious partying at Carnival &#8230; and still get your teeth worked out!\nSeriously, think about it. Carnivals are coming! starting on the 12th of February&#8230; where do you rather be?\n",
