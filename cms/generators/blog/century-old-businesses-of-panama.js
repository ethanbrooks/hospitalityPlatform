Maduro (135 years old).\nThe Felix B. Maduro store was actually born in Casco Viejo in 1877 (we were part of Colombia back then), and it was called &#8220;Maduro &amp; Company&#8221;. Founded by Samuel and Esther Maduro, I have a friend looking for the first building they first occupied in Calle 8va, but the building most people remember as the cradle of the company is actually one they moved into in 1920`s next to the Cathedral, at Central Avenue, which now has plans to be restored as a boutique hotel.\nAn excellent location,  it is one of the tallest buildings around the area, but for me the &#8220;wao&#8221; factor was the big garden at the back. I can only imagine how beautiful this store most have been.\nAccording to the article, today the company has more than a 1000 employees and has diversified. Now they have nine stores in Panama and have branched, specializing now in different areas such as toys, beauty and outlets.\nIf you want to find out more about Felix B. Maduro, click HERE \nFelix B.
