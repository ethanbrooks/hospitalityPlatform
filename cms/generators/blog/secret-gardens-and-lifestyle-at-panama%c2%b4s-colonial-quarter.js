Children will play, a community will gather, an important connection will be gained.\nAll of these being the true elements of a good lifestyle.  Somehow having these old, basic principles come to life has brought a new dimension to today´s modern living. And this reveals what Casco Viejo is all about: not  a museum style colonial city, but a real one, with real people injecting their energy and values to it.\n\n",
