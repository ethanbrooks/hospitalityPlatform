  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nIt was a long and bumpy road with Hotel Central. But after more or less 7 years, there was light at the end of the tunel: the hotel is opening! still a couple of weeks more for the rooms to be available to the public, but their main restaurant Nueve Reinas has opened.\nIt is an Argentinian style restaurant with specialty in meats. We ordered the tuna tataki for some balance. One of our friends ordered her meat red and the other one ordered his meat 3/4. They both loved it.Â  We ordered tataki and corvina and they were both very good.\nThumbs up and congratulations! looking forward to having the full 135 room operating hotel!\n     \n&nbsp;\n\n",
