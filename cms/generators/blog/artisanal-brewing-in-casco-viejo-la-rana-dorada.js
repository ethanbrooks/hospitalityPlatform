Guess what? now we have one in Casco Viejo! check out La Rana Dorada:\nLocated in front of the Centenario park in Casco Viejo, just at the very entrance to San Felipe, it has an outdoors terrace, so you can bring your dog! (always appreciated for all of us dog owners!).  The space is well done, but the commanding piece is the beer brewery.  Fantastic! they produce all sorts of combinations, they even had one that tasted like orange.  Yes, and if you doubt it does taste like orange, you better go and try it yourself.\nContact info: 269-2989/ 269-2990.  Please note these phones are from La Rana Dorada in Vía Argentina, but they can take your reservations.\n\n",
