  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nWhen I was little, my grandmother used to do a big nativity scene at the lobby of her house for Christmas.  My brother, cousin and I participated putting it together, filling up the &#8220;town&#8221; with &#8220;residents&#8221; made of every toy we could find. So if you looked closer, you had on the same &#8220;land in time&#8221; small green soldiers, dinosaurs and probably a couple of Transformers right next to the classic donkeys, cows, sheep and baby Jesus. After finishing hers, a super treat was to go see other people`s nativity scenes. I remember this guy who used the whole garage, and it was awesome: every single detailed was perfect, he even included at some point working fountains and mills. I think he also had dinosaurs.\nKeeping with the holiday spirits, yesterday Casco Viejo`s Neighborhood Association (AVACA) organized a small event to visit the amazing collection of around the world nativity scenes of the Lewis family. Members of AVACA could admire hundreds of big and small scenes from literally everywhere: Europe, Africa, America, Asia, Australia. It was fun to see each one`s interpretation of that single event, and how beautifully each one spoke of its own culture. There was also the &#8220;baby corner&#8221;, my favorite version made with little rubber ducks.\nThanks so much to the Lewis family for allowing AVACA to come in and enjoy this unique collection!\n          \n",
