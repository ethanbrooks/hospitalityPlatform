Memories are filling\nthe room quickly, running from one corner to the other, clashing and crashing between\nthemselves, competing to be the very first one. It’s all a mix. But I’m pretty sure\nit started on a Sunday, at an age where my size was the same as the park bench. I\ncan recall this because my favorite thing was to get a “raspado” near Las Bóvedas,\nand I could barely make it to the top of the pushcart. Raspado Flavor: red with 10\ncents of extra condensed milk. I don’t know how I survived to so much sugar. Those\nfamily trips were not only fun but fascinating, the Casco was completely in ruins\nbut it was a charmer for any 5 year old, a discovery at every corner. The best of\nthose Sunday trips were the stories. The reason: almost all my family on my father\nside was either born or raised in Casco back in the 50´s. Walking through the Casco\nwas a window to my father’s childhood, to my grandparent’s youth. I could sense there\nwas a connection, a root I liked and was part of.\n\nMy “nonnos” (we always called them in the Italian fashion\nbecause of my mother who was Italian and because “abuelo” in Spanish sounds like an\nold person…not my grandparents!!!) lived in the Casco back when it was all\nPanama\nhad. Remember\nPanama\nonly turned into a Republic in 1903, my grandparents were born around 1910 (my grandfather),\nso they lived in the Casco in the 40´s and 50´s. At that time, the Casco was the entire\ncity of\nPanama\n, period.  They both lived at a side of the current\nCanal\nMuseum\non\n6th Street\nand\nA Avenue\n, former “Correos y Telégrafos” (Mail and Telegraphy Office, back then the only way\nto communicate with the rest of\nPanama\nand the world) and both worked as Director and Manager at this important office. My\nfather and aunt (Adolfo and tía\nIsis\n) where raised in an apartment on the first floor, playing on Plaza Catedral and many\nother corners of the Casco. So every Sunday visit, my father would point out the house\nand remember: “and this is the balcony where we lived, and right beside it is the\napartment of Doña Laura, the teacher. She used to have a big apartment full of books\nwhere we sneaked in to do our homework.” Incredibly enough, Doña Laura is still living\nthere, on the same apartment. She is almost 90 years old now. I met her early this\nyear. When I introduced myself as the daughter of Adolfito, the son of Fina, her eyes\nglowed and started asking for my aunt, my nonna and everybody.\n\nOne of the best anecdotes was the shot-on-the-balcony\nstory. It was during one of the three presidencies of Arnulfo Arias Madrid. The military\nhad just carried out their famous coup (1951) and my father must have been 5 years\nold. At that time my grandmother was actually working at the\nPresidencial\nPalace\nas a secretary (back when there were only six people in the entire Presidential Compound,\ncounting the President) and because of the political unrest she had just quit and\nwas home with the family. There were shooting on the streets and in Calle 6ta were\nsome “rebels” were shooting from the roofs. My grandfather went to the balcony to\nclose the doors and someone shot in his direction. Luckily, the balcony received the\nbullet. The mark is still there today, as we noticed this past weekend during our\nSunday stroll with him.\n\nMy next clear childhood memory is at the National Theatre.\nWe were at a ballet performance from the National Ballet Company.  Later\non, at age 9, I started studying ballet with the\nNational\nSchool\n, but this memory seems to be prior. The theatre vault and its great surreal painting\n(by master painter Roberto Lewis) always impressed me. That night I remember clearly\nit was Gloria Barrios and Andrés Nieto (later on I had the honor to dance on the same\nstage with them) on a piano piece I later on learned it was Chopin. Andrés was playing\nthe musician while Gloria was his ethereal muse. Going to the Theatre was a fantastic\ntreat and my parents always took my brother and me whenever they had an opportunity.  I\nwould return to this theatre later over and over as a dancer with the National Ballet.\nFor a while it was the headquarters of the company, so I got to be in the Casco every\nday. So in more than one way, the Casco is full of personal landmarks, some made even\nbefore I was born!\n\nI hope you had enjoyed my first blog attempt and had encouraged\nyou to write a bit of your own experiences!\n\nHere are some pictures for you:\nMy grandaunt and grandmother, doña Laura, the building they lived in, the ceiling\npainting at the theatre.\n\n",
