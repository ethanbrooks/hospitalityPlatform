It was organized by residents, businesses and a regional group called Cali 7 with members who traveled from Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica to participate.  Thanks to all AVACA members who participated, and specially to Gisela Timmins, Dayanara and Miriam who worked so hard to put it together.  And to the businesses who donated to make this happen: Las Clementinas, Arco Properties, Conservatorio S.A., Casco Station (hope not be forgetting anyone!). Thanks also to Gio from Aprojusan and for the dynamic group of the dance program Enlaces from Fundacion Calicanto.  My favorite part, though, was the one organized by John at the TLG Gym&#8230;Fantastic!!!\n          \n",
