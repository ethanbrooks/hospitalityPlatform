  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nThis week, several things are happening around the Panama Jazz Fest. One of them is the opening of the American Trade Restaurant. We were there for the tastings and had a great time. Loved everything, but specially the chayote soup with chile poblano and the tuna.  The ambiance is terrific, your meal will have views to La Merced church and I think eventually they`ll open at Plaza Herrera.  My favorite house cocktail: Nebula . But if you are into vintage drinks, they`ve rescued a couple of recipes from old Colón (Caribbean side of Panama).  If you would like to explore them, ask for Haleluia or Bird of Paradise.  Cheers!\nWebsite of American Trade Hotel Here\n  \n",
