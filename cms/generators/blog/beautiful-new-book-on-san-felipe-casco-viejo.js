Ida Vallarino worked small models of the houses, based on photos and her experience. Amazing. My favorites? you`ll see here Las Clementinas (of course!) but also a Panamanian curiosity that makes sense only to female Panamanians: the first Felix B Maduro store. Can you guess where it was? I do&#8230; \nThe book is for sale at Felipe Motta, go check it out!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
