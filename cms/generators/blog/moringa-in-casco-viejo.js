  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nThe first time I heard the name was buying tea at Casa Sucre. Alyce had this &#8220;Moringa&#8221; tea that tasted great and apparently was not only good but super good for you. The name sounded so funny and the photo of the leaves seemed familiar, just I couldn´t place it in my mind. But then my husband pointed out to me: remember that tree Spencer planted in Calle 4ta that he said it is being proposed as the solution to malnutrition in Africa? I couldn´t believe it, the famous &#8220;Tree of Life&#8221; was right in front of me!Researching in youtube, I see that it can be propagated by sticking a branch on the ground. The leaves have kind of a nutty taste, but just like watercress you might find it quite spicy if you eat the stems, so watch out. Don´t over do it!\nIn Wikipedia, I find that this plant has a ton of everything, quoting here:\n&#8220;The leaves are rich in protein, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C and minerals. 100g of fresh Moringa leaves have 8.3 g protein, 434 mg calcium, 404 mg potassium, 738 μg vitamin A, and 164 mg vitamin C Feeding the high protein leaves to cattle has been shown to increase weight gain by up to 32% and milk production by 43 to 65%. The seeds contain 30 to 40% oil that is high in oleic acid, while degreased meal is 61% protein. The defatted meal is a flocculant and can be used in water purification to settle out sediments and undesirable organisms&#8221;\nFrom Tree of Life.org I learn that it has: 7 times the vitamin C of oranges, 4 times the vitamin A of carrots, 4 times the calcium in milk, 3 times the potassium in bananas and 2 times the protein in yogurt.\nSo now I`m using it on tea, salads, stir fries and smoothies.  Try it out! if you want to plant a branch let us know and we`ll give you a stick.\n  \n&nbsp;\n",
