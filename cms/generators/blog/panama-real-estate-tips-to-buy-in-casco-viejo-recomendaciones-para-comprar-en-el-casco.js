  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Antiguo\nCasco Viejo, San Felipe\nI often comment on my clients that Casco Antiguo is like Woody Allen: either you hate\nit or you love it, there is no &#8220;in between&#8221;. It is definatly not for everyone. For\nthe right person, it is very easy to fall in love with it on their first visit. They\nget the same feeling as a kid walking into a store with tons of candy, wide smile\non their faces, dreams about their restored home.&nbsp; But&#8230; hey! wake up! it takes\nsome serious work and personal honesty to go further this point and succeed.\nIf you decide to get serious, there are some things you need to get very honest with\nyourself and draw your own limits.&nbsp; You might still be open to several options,\nbut you need to slowly get down to earth with the type of property you can would be\nhappy with and can afford.\nStep one: read our handbook. It´s free, and gives you a lot of background.\nStep two: define your goals. Do you want a home for yourself? do you want to restore\n(recommended for people with construction or similar background that are willing to\nspend a lot of time and energy on the ground) or do you want to have an apartment?\nAre you planning to live here or have a vacation home? How much are you willing to\nspend?\nNow: big note here. Answers like: &#8220;it depends on the property&#8221; are missleading. It\nis not honest nor with yourself nor with the realtor. Of course it depends on the\nproperty. What you need to be clear and let others know is how high are you willing\nto go for your &#8220;Super Non Plus Ultra Ideal Property&#8221;.&nbsp;\nSo really sit down and calculate a number. Don´t be afraid of telling the realtor\nwhat this number is. They will be dead honest with you and tell you straight up if\nthere is anything for you out there that matches your desire and budget.\nIf you are thinking on restoring a ruin, then keep in mind you will need enough funding\nfor purchasing and construction. Financing is available, but it will heavily depend\non your own credit. You need to have at least 30% of the cash on your side to restore\n+ the purchase of the land.\nStep three: Walk the Casco. At day, at night. Feel it. Breathe it. Get used to its\nrythms. There is no point in buying blindly. This is a special place and buying is\na big decision. Rent a short term rental apartment and take your time.\nStep four: Get a good, specialized realtor. Yes, well, that´s a no brainer for me,\nsince this is all I do 24/7, but I have my reasons to strongly suggest going with\na professional: they have far more information and far deeper understanding about\nthe area and it´s dinamic. It is just that simple. You can try and run around yourself,\nbut it will take you a long time to find something you like and will loose a lot of\nresources in the way. You will loose opportunities and grow grey hair.\nStep five: Get a good lawyer.&nbsp; Don´t go cheap on this. Get a good lawyer. You\nmight want to visit some banks in case you go foward, it is easier to open a bank\naccount.\nStep six: understand the process. A good realtor and lawyer can explain how things\nwork. Be patient. Casco is a sellers market at the moment, so it takes quite some\npatience and you need to be prepared to go with asking price.\nStep seven: work on your ideal situation until you narrow it down to concrete, existing\noptions. Then you can &#8220;pull the trigger&#8221; and get your property!!!\nGood luck!!!\n",
