Juan Gomez, Espacio Karuna`s yoga instructor and Thai massage specialist is giving a relaxation technique class based on breathing.  Surrounded by the ocean breeze and sounds, we breathe in and breathe out, belly in, belly out.  Half hour of this, strangely, I didn´t grow dizzy but relaxed.  I wanted to go straight back to bed, but instead, I walked back home for a nice fruity breakfast.  And then walked to my office.\nThese are the small daily miracles I love from living and working in Casco Viejo! No matter what comes afterwards, my day already has positive colors and ribbons on it.\n\n&nbsp;\n",
