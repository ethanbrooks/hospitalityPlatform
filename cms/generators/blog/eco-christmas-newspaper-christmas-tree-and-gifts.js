I pick through the year photos in the newspaper that catched my attention, especially if they define well a person I know. So for me, Christmas starts quite early!  I like it because it makes me think about my beloved ones all year through.\nThis year, I included a new element: the newspaper Christmas Tree.  I decorated it with garbage from the beach and light blue plastic bags.  My dog destroyed a pillow, so I got the cotton balls out and used them as well. Here is a photo of my Christmas tree on the works.   This week I´ll post the final &#8220;masterpiece&#8221;&#8230;.\nHere are the wrappings that I thought where best&#8230; I hope it gets you inspired!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
