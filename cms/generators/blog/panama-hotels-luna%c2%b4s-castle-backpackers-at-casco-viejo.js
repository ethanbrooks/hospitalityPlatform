  "blog_article": " Panama, Casco Viejo\nCasco Antiguo, San Felipe\n\nSo few times we get to meet the faces behind the places. Daniel, Dan and David are the &#8220;3 amigos&#8221; from Luna´s Castle, Casco Viejo´s new youth hostal at the entrance of San Felipe. The hostal is located at the former Casa Ehrman at 9th Street. It has wonderful views to Panama´s Bay and the modern city skyline, but also the house, as it was never abandoned, is almost in its original form, giving a great sense of charm and history.\nThe house has a great patio surrounded by stone walls. An original stone vault is the perfect place for a bar, I think the guys are already setting it up!\nHow to contact them: 262 1540 / mondotaituhostel@yahoo.com   If you are looking to visit several sites in Panama, they also own a couple of youth hostals in Bocas del Toro (Casa Heike and Mondo Taitu, for example).\nNot interested in backpacking? we have other options too! \n\n",
