  "blog_article": "Wake up, go surfing, come back, shower, go to work.  Only for the adventurous type! you can actually surf in Casco Viejo when there is a good swell. Actually, the current Panama Female Champion, Samantha, taught herself how to surf on this wave. A neighbour right next door to us, she is a firecracker.  Today, she competes internationally, her last competition was in Chile earlier this year.  Made it to the top 13, her biggest challenge being the water temperature&#8230; we have such nice warm waters!\n Here are two pictures, one of her surfing alone and the other one is the wave taken yesterday in Casco Viejo at Las Bovedas Point.  Enjoy!\n",
