  "blog_article": "\nI can´t believe we are already on the 8th edition of the Panama Jazz Festival. This event, which is the brainchild of Panamanian Jazz legend Danilo Perez and his lovely wife Patricia Zarate,  has grown at an incredible rythm, not only in audience but in quality. It is already established as one of the most important Jazz Festivals in the region. But it is so much more than music. It is a platform to their educational programs which open doors to kids of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in Panama to amazing institutions such as the Berklee College of Music.\nThis year, the festival will be dedicated to Panamanian Musician Vitin Paz and will be held from January 10th to the 15th.  Not sure who will be attending this year, but fantastic names like John Patitucci and Ellis Marsallis have been already on the Fest stage, some more than once.\nThe festival usually has a wonderful closing with an outdoors concert at Casco Viejo, which this year will be held at Plaza Herrera instead of Plaza Cathedral.\nThumbs up to Danilo and Patricia!!!\n",
