  "blog_article": " Panama, Casco Viejo &#8211; Casco Antiguo, San Felipe\n\nThe Event: \n\nThe dates are set: the 6th edition of the Panama Jazz Fest to be held in 2009 will take place from January 12th to the 17th. This mega music event is a wonderful moment to enjoy the best of Panama´s culture, which is more Caribbean than Central America (as geography might suggest. Panama´s flavor is more like Cuba than Costa Rica, for example) along with international jazz starts.  Paralel to the concert, the Fundacion Danilo Perez also runs workshops and gives music scholarships to Panamanian and latin american students to study in highly recognized music schools like the New England Conservatory, Berklee College of Music and the Conservatorio de Puerto Rico.  Even more, the Foundation is working hard to found its own music school in Panama. Where? &#8230;. in Casco Antiguo! of course. But where in Casco Viejo? hum&#8230;. I think I´ll save that for my next posting&#8230;. stay tuned!\nIf you are interested in participating at the auditions or know more about the festival, please go to their official website. You´ll find application documents and other details. You´ll find also ways to volunteer in the Foundation.\nWhere to Stay During the Panama Jazz Fest:\nIf you are interested to travel for those dates, make your reservations in advance! there is nothing like staying in Casco Antiguo, where you can walk to the concerts and events and then just crawl back to bed. Here are your options for acomodations (hotels and private apartments on short term rentals) in Casco Viejo:\nThe Canal House: beautiful 3 room hotel. Can sleep a group of 8. The best is to rent the entire house! steps away from where the main closing concert will be. \nCafé de Asis: info@arcoproperties.com. Short term rental apartment on Plaza Bolivar. Few steps away from the National theatre.\nLos 4 Tulipanes: short term rental apartments. \nLuna´s Castle :   beautiful building and comfortable backpackers.
