  "blog_article": "Yesterday we just received a mail from Canal House about a guest that enjoyed his stay in Casco Antiguo. They forward to us an interesting post from Keys Life newspaper from USA; with a lovely review.\n \n“The Canal House is a shinning example of the revived San Felipe, as the Casco is properly known. Smack in the middle of that small peninsula, the hotel is a short drive from the Bridge of the Americas and Amador, the gateway to the Panama Canal.”\n \n“The next morning, just after breakfast, a religious procession parades past our balcony window. Masses of school kids, clergy and uniformed people, and wooden statue of holy man, ramble down the cobblestones. This was enough to get us out, exploring what felt like an older version of the New Orleans French Quarter, Barcelona’s Gothic Section, or maybe the present back alleys and side-streets of Havana.”\n \nQuotes by Eric Holowacz\n\nKeys Life Newspaper\nCasco Antiguo\n",
