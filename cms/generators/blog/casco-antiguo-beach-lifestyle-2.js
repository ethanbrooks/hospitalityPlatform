It actually has several beaches, this one below being one of the biggest and most used, especially on Sundays when the local softball, beisball or&nbsp; soccer leagues show up with their group of fans. The entire Sunday becomes a bundle of screaming: &#8220;corre, corre&#8221; (run, run!) &#8220;dale, dale&#8221; (hit it, hit it!) or ayala vida! ( polite version of: #%&amp;#). Carne en palito everywhere, pollo asado and beer to cheer both winners and loosers. \nHow was it that Panama lost it´s beach lifestyle, I don´t really know. I am glad,\nthough, that this extint way of lifestyle (for the modern Panama City) is still very\nmuch alive here. Granted, you won´t see girls running around in bikinis or guys in\ntight pants, but it is really enjoyable and relaxed. Next Sunday you are around, don´t\nforget to visit them!&nbsp; ps. just don´t get into the water yet, we are still working\non that one.\n\n\n",
