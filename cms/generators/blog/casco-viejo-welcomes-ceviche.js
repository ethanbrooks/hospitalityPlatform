Fresh and spicy, they were the creation of Waldo, the owner of the recently opened &#8220;Ceviche&#8221; restaurant at Casco Viejo.  Waldo has lived in Singapure, and its ceviche does show some Asian influence!\nHis restaurant is almost a Ceviche Bar, a mix between a café and a fast food. You can catch and run, or you can enjoy right there.  His labels read &#8220;All Natural, Pacific Ocean Catch, Lime &amp; Sea Salt&#8221;.   Simply delicious!\nLocation: Central Avenue and 3rd Street, next to Manolo Caracol.\nCheck out their website: www.cevichepescafina.com\n[slideshow] \n",
