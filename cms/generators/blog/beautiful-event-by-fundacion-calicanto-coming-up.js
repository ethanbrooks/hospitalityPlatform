Next Wednesday, August 28th at the Canal Museum. Twenty women from Casco Viejo, Santa Ana and Chorrillo will graduate from a program that has given them the personal and professional tools to take control of their lives and break the cycle of poverty.\nThe program`s results are outstanding. After graduation, more than 70% are able to get permanent employment&#8230; and able to keep it a year later. It is a direct impact on the whole family, one woman at a time. If you are in Casco, you can´t miss it!\n\n&nbsp;\n",
