  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nTuesday, the Casco Viejo Neighborhood Association (AVACA) organized a fundraising event to raise funds for its recycling program. The event was at Nuratti, a small but chic hotel in Casco Viejo. The event was a silent auction of art pieces made with material from the recycling center and themes about nature. There were also a couple of interactive pieces, where the public was able to participate creating a map of Panama with bottle caps and a tower of gliding paint.\nThe event was super fun and a success! The program will be able to buy the initial equipment to start recollecting recycling material from homes and restaurants in Casco Viejo.  More coming soon, as so much is needed. We would like to thank specially organizers Ingrid Moore, Tarina Rodriguez and Jennifer Hotsko.  Hotel Nuratti for donating the space and artists Jorge Suanzes and Alejandra Tabares for donating their beautiful work. Loved the chandelier!\nCongratulations to all!\n  \n",
