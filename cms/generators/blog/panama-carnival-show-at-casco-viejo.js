Long line on Sunday!  Finally took a peek at the window and saw this small world of fantasy glowing from inside.   The three historic vaults were filled with carnival dresses, an exhibition put together by the Institute of Culture and the two most famous carnival queens in Panama: Las Tablas Calle Arriba and Calle Abajo.\nLittle girls with faces in awe, people taking photos everywhere. Carnival is by far one of the most enjoyed holidays in the country and Las Tablas has positioned itself as the &#8220;must see&#8221; town during the celebrations.\nI have to say I was quite impressed with the collection, which seemed to rival even Brazil!!!\nThe show will be there until next Sunday!\n\n",
