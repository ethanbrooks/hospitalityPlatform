  "blog_article": "In the last few years, Casco Antiguo (Panama´s Colonial City) has become the axis of most of Panama City´s art events. Small, big, experimental or not. From the annual Panama Jazz Fest organized by Fundacion Danilo Perez to last night´s Paraguayan Embassy music performance at the San Jose (Golden Altar) church, Casco Viejo seems a natural fit to sensible souls.\nAnd now, the FAO Theatre Festival is showing up. From March 17th to the 24th all scenarios available in Casco (National Theatre, Anita Villalaz and even LaCasona) will show plays from Colombia, Argentina, USA, Panama and more.\nThe only thing missing is coordination between all the theatres and organizers to post their events, as many of them are individually produced and there isn´t a known public forum to promote them correctly.  However, it makes it exciting for the residents of the area, who are able to enjoy these events as they walk by them.\n\n",
