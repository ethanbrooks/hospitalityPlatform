We`ll feature one by one, starting with Casa Boyd, a project at Calle 6ta with a young vibe and a spacious offer.\nOnly two apartments and one commercial space. The building is a modern, concrete building, with high ceilings and a great sense of space.  We like both apartments as they fit very well into Casconian`s lifestyles: one is a loft one bedroom (Apartment No. 2 ) and the other one is a 1.5 bedrooms (Apartment No. 1), which means you have a second space to use as an office or guest bedroom.\nA spacious balcony overlooking Calle 6ta, one of the widest side streets in San Felipe.\nBelow, a unique property: a 230 mt2 commercial space that is being planned as a restaurant. It will include an internal patio with a transparent roof, so you can use it all year round.  The locale can also be divided into smaller ones, in case a different concept is required.\n   \n",
