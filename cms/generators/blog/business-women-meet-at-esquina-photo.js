  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Antiguo\nOne of the things I love about Casco is that its community is always opening spaces to meet, mingle and share. That was the occasion when a couple of weeks ago, Esquina Photo along with Ahden Busch organized a get together for “Casco`s business women”.  Although I knew many of the girls attending, I did meet new people and loved how different country flags keep adding to Casco Viejo`s neighborhood.  From Panama, Spain, USA, Italy, Jamaica (and I`m probably forgetting a few more), we shared common interests, wine and cheese. Congratulations to Ingrid Moore and Ahden Busch for organizing it! Thank you!!!\n   \n",
