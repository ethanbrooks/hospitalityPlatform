  "blog_article": "For the past ten years, Casco Antiguo has gone through a delicate process of revitalization which includes as many angles as a city can afford: urbanism, community, historical architecture protection, legal and so many more.\nAs it moves forward, it is very difficult to convey how much it has changed without an image bank that would be the witness of the recovery.\nLooking through my archives, I found this image of Hotel Colombia from  1999,  now one of the most priced buildings and condos in Casco Antiguo.  Located at Plaza Bolivar, the building was one of the first restorations in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Hotel Colombia has parking and a beautiful roof terrace with a pool and a panoramic view that includes the bay of Panama and the modern city.  Several restaurants have opened on its groundfloor: Casablanca and Ciao Pescao. Soon a sushi corner will open its doors.\nThe same process that happened to Plaza Bolivar back in 2000 is happening now at Plaza Herrera where at least two hotels are being built, and businesses have started to sprout.\n\nSeveral high end projects are starting to deliver in the area, the largest one being Benedetti Hermanos, one of the few historic restorations in the entire district that has pool, underground parking, elevator, central air and central gas.\nThe government is also investing heavily in the area. This year, they´ve started to enhance the access area and combine it with green areas and parking.\n",
