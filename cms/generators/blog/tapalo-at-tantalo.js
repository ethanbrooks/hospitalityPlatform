Through Casco Viejo`s Neighborhood Association (AVACA) we collaborate fully with all the recycling initiatives, beach cleanings and general crazy stuff we come up to deal creatively with our material. So imagine my pleasure to walk into Tantalo and see the most recent pieces by artist Michael Sager, who has been  working on &#8220;Tápalo&#8221;, a concept where he uses plastic bottle caps (in Spanish &#8220;tapa&#8221;) to make lamps and other objects.\nIf, like me, you have a strong interest in recycling, you can´t miss this show. All the lamp shades are by him, plus some of the pieces in the wall. And if you are interested in contacting the artist, let the staff at Tántalo know!\n  \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
