  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Antiguo\nBack in 1998 things where quite different in Casco Viejo. It was more Viejo than Casco.\nIt was a fragile, run down, un protected site most people in Panama (government and\nnot) had &#8220;written off&#8221;.&nbsp; Back then, a group of passionate profesionals stood\nup and basically made it happen: brought the attention of UNESCO and worked until\nthis endangered species was protected for life.\nOne of the most important axis of this petition was Fundacion Calicanto. For years,\nthey worked very hard to propose a law to protect these wonderful buildings, creating\nthe foundations for all the appreciation we see today.\nSome years have passed and with the buildings protected, Calicanto has changed its\nfocus towards the human patrimony of the Casco Antiguo. They have great programs we\ncan all be part of. From trainning women in hotel skills to art courses for children\nand urban agriculture, their goal is to attack the roots of poverty through providing\ntools to the local population that will enable them to be part of the growth of their\nown neighborhood, and through this, revitalize themselves.\nOur Casco Viejo is so small and helping is so easy. Making a real difference takes\nvery little. We welcome you to join the Foundation and be part of their programs.\nYou can volunteer time or resources&#8230; or both!\nTo contact Heriberto Trejos (CalicantoÂ´s Director) , just write to: fcalicanto@gmail.com\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n",
