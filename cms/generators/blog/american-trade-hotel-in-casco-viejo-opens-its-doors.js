  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nSimply the most ambitious and beautiful restoration done to date in Casco Viejo.  A delicate blend of Panama`s tropical culture with contemporary style.  Inside and outside connect through triple height glass windows, lush tropical plants inside echo with Plaza Herrera`s big trees.  Thoughtful details everywhere, my favorite being the old style library, where books have been cherry picked by the owners evoking the golden era of travel, back when it really meant exploring. You`ll find books from pioneers telling their tales of joy, struggle and wonder. You`ll also find a pool, a gym, and a jazz bar (opening soon!).\nI should do a post only on the American Trade History. But I`m so excited that for now I`m just going to post some of my photos&#8230;\n     \n&nbsp;\n",
