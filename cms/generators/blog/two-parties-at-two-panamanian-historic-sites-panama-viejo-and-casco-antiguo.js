  "blog_article": "This weekend, a special event put in the map of young Panamanians two historic towns that are also UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Panama La Vieja and Casco Viejo.  Gabo Castillo from Hip Magazine and clothing designer Annie Chajin decided to do a &#8220;man to man&#8221; (or woman?) competition to see who could get the best party going. Gabo picked Panama La Vieja and Annie kept her turff at Casco Viejo.\nIt was a complete success, both towns were filled up with people that came from everywhere.  Casco Viejo offered probably the best package: the &#8220;ruta del Casco&#8221; (the path of Casco) included special offers and discounts on several restaurants and bars.  But the most important thing was that this event brought light to both cities, who are separated by land but intimately joined by their history and value as they are both World Heritage Sites.\nCongratulations for Gabo and Annie!\nIf you want to learn more about the Ruta del Casco, check out the article at The Visitor HERE \n&nbsp;\n",
