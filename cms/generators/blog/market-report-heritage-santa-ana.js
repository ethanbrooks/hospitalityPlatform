  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nSanta Ana is under construction. If we analyze the developments already being built in the historic area, we´ll find that the energy is being placed in the axis that goes from B Avenue all the way to the back of the Santa Ana Church, and then a second axis through 15th Street. Several groups are investing in different ways: restoring for commercial portfolios, or revitalizing residential areas with mixed use at affordable prices for first home owners.\nPlease note that Santa Ana is a large district, and that not everything is within the Casco Antiguo monument by UNESCO.  That is why we´ll be talking here about the Heritage portion of Santa Ana.\n&nbsp;\n\nDarker circles: under construction\n&nbsp;\nCommercial and Investment Development:\n\nMainly located around Plaza Santa Ana and towards B Avenue, we already see fully finished buildings in operations such as the Selina Hostel in B Avenue (awesome roof terrace with pool!), and under construction residential in the $250k range, at the Plaza´s side. There are also cultural projects in the planning and fundraising stage like the Variedades Theater.\nAlso, but towards Calle 13 and Cinta Costera, you´ll find La Cuadra, a residential project.\n\n&nbsp;\nAffordable Residential Cluster:\nBehind Plaza Santa Ana you´ll find a cluster of properties that are known as La Quince. This cluster is being developed by Grupo Conservatorio, our mother company, and is mixed use. Our vision: to revitalize the barrio offering the opportunity to people from the area, live or work, to buy their first home. This group of properties includes cultural projects such as La Manzana, with art schools, and even a 150 seat theatre. The apartments start at $85,000 and the banks that are financing first owners are La Hipotecaria, Caja de Ahorros and Banistmo.\nThe cluster includes the following properties, click on each one to see more:\nCasa Balcones: Under construction, aprox delivery: beginnings of 2020\nLa Manzana: Under construction, aprox delivery: ends 2020\nCasa Korsi: starting this year, aprox delivery 2022\nCasa Quijano: starting this year, aprox delivery 2021\n\nCasa Balcones en Construcción\n\nLa Manzana en Construcción\n\nLa Manzana Interiores\nCasa Balcones, renders. ©Conservatorio, S.A\nCasa Balcones, renders. ©Conservatorio, S.A\n  \n&nbsp;\n",
