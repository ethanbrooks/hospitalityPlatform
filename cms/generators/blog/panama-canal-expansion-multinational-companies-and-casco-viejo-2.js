On one hand, the Panama Canal expansion project\n   will cost over $5 billion dollars, and on the other hand, big guys such as Hewlett\n   &#8211; Packard, Caterpillar, the Swiss Sanofi- Aventis, Procter &amp; Gamble and Sinope\n   from\n      China\n   have either expressed their interest of moving headquarters here or are actually doing\n   so.\n   Panama has always benefit from its strategic location but for such a small country\n   and considering the volume of business these group of companies bring together or\n   individually to the table this will have a huge positive repercussion.\n   Suddenly, airlines that had left the country before such as KLM are flying back to\n   Panama\n   again, re opening direct flights to\n      Amsterdam\n   . Banesco, the Venezuelan bank, has recently jumped into the Panamanian pool, probably\n   looking for safer waters.\n   Now, what does all this has to do with Casco Antiguo?\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\n   It so happens that most of these companies are basing\n   in the former\n   Canal\n Zone\n   , which is 5 minutes away from Casco Antiguo! Casco Viejo suddenly becomes a wonderful\n   choice for future employees and executives to live in. &nbsp;\n   \n\n\n   \n   &nbsp;\n   \n\n\n   A central point between their jobs and modern\n      Panama\n   , they can have it all within a few minutes. It is extremely easy to go back and forth\n   to the Canal Zone, we do it often to go jogging at the Causeway,\n      Administration\n      Building\n   (great “steps” workout!) or to run to the top of Ancon Hill. &nbsp;Back\n   “home” they would have a handful of good lifestyle choices, since some of the best\n   restaurants, café’s, bars and theatres are based in Casco.\n   \n\n\n   \n   &nbsp;\n   \n\n\n   Location, location, location!!! &nbsp;\n   \n\n\n   \n   &nbsp;\n   \n\n",
