However, we had a lot of fun!  Platea started early, as usual, with jazz night on Thursday and salsa on Friday. But La Casona had also a nice couple of events and our favorite &#8220;heavy metal &#8211; rock&#8221; bar called Baños Públicos (Public Bathrooms) was at its best with Beto playing anything from Hotel California and Canto Boliviano to Samba. Wao!\nHere are some shots from La Casona. I was so happy to finally take some pictures from inside. The wonderful high ceilings of the art deco building they are at now makes such a  great spot for alternative theatre or movie&#8230; but it is hard to photograph! We where there to see the theatre play Karaoke Sentimental, a play by Teatro Lagartija. They also had the art show 7 Pinceles, with fun paintings by Rolando de Sedas, Marta Noemi and Marta Sanchez, among others.\n",
