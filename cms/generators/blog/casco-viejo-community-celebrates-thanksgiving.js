At least four or five languages were being spoken in the party: Spanish, English, Italian, French and German.  And at least two dialects: Spanglish and Itañol.   A beautifully eclectic community celebrated and shared food among friends, children running everywhere.\n&#8220;Did you notice children here speak four different languages?&#8221; said Clara, my associate and lifeforce behind the party.  I looked around and saw them playing together and thought, well, somehow they are understanding each other pretty well!\nThe food was delicious and better yet among friends, Thanksgiving is a wonderful moment were new neighbors get to know old ones and in tune with what`s going on.\nCongratulations to the organizers and thanks to Casa del Horno for lending AVACA its beautiful restaurant space!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
