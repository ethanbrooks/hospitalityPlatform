  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nYesterday, while doing my home shores, I heard a distinctive flute playing from down the street.  I recognized it from my childhood, and I ran down to meet the guy, probably the last one in Panama in his trade. I bet I was the only one in the neighborhood who even knew what the meaning of the flute was.\nMr. Enzo is an Argentinian who has been in Panama for more than 30 years. His trade is a dying one in this era of easy “buy and throw away”. He sharpens. Knives, scissors, machetes, electric knives and even small ones like the tools used for manicure.  His prices range from $1 for a pair of scissors to $3 for a lawn mower. He rides on his bicycle and his only advertising while he roams the street is his flute, which he plays in a very particular way, almost like a Quetzal song.\nHe will come to your home if you call him: 6023-9378.  For less than $10 I sharpened every knife I had and threw in a machete from a neighbor who does gardening.  His flyer calls himself the “Scissors Doctor”.  It reminded me of a time where people were more frugal, repairing what they had instead of throwing it away.  My knives are now back in shape, cutting as if they were just out of the box.  Fully recommended!\n    \n",
