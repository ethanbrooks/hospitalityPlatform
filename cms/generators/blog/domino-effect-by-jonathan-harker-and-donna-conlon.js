  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nFor months I saw artists Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker rescuing old bricks that were being replaced in Casco Viejo. Carrying them in buckets and then by cart, piling them without giving anything away. Last January 16th, in Diablo Rosso, we could see the final product: their piece &#8220;Domino Effect&#8221; portrays the bricks falling (or pushing?) through the whole Casco, in a commentary on how the city of Panama is changing, and how Casco Viejo &#8211; a World Heritage Site &#8211; has fought to keep its authenticity.\nThe bricks &#8220;walk you&#8221; through Casco, in a very zen way, with humor and love, with poetry. Someone said that at the end you felt those bricks were your friends, and maybe he was right.\nPlease pass by Diablo Rosso and check it out. They have the video and also the photographic show. Kudos to both Jonathan and Donna! the question remains&#8230; what are you going to do with your &#8220;friends&#8221; now?\n  \n&nbsp;\n",
