  "blog_article": "Casco Antiguo, San Felipe\nPanama, Casco Viejo\n\nLast night, a group of friends organized a tapas night at Canal\nHouse in Casco Viejo with Argimiro, a Panamanian young chef who studied in Spain\nand even did his professional practice at the famous El Bulli Restaurant (Ferrán Adriá,\n2 and 3 Michelin stars!).&nbsp; When Argimiro returned to Panama, he fell in love\nwith Casco Viejo and I have to say we fell in love with his food, so anytime he organizes\na party or just a tapas night we are more than thrilled. And last night was really\ngreat.\nThe thing with tapas is that you think they are so small you are not really eating\nthat much&#8230; but wao! we had so much interesting stuff, reinterpretacions of Panamanian\ncuisine (like our carimañolas but with other ingredients), all the way to duck (but\nmade into cigar shapes and fresh &amp; spicy orange sauce as a side dish). My favorite\nwas a corvina fish with two types of sauces but made in different textures, so one\nfloated on top of the other, one spicier than the other. Some sort of mouse and the\nother was more of a sauce. My friend loved the shrimp, tasted almost grilled but it\nwas zafron. And the dessert&nbsp; (I fall for the sweets!) was another reinterpretation\nthat involved strawberries and some sort of cream I´m still trying to define, decorated\nwith edible flowers.\nI can´t wait for him to open his restaurant! it is expected to open in December, right\non Plaza Catedral. He´ll\nwork with local ingredients from our urban\nagriculture program, so it promises to be an experience! healthy and sustainable.\nI have some really weird stuff growing on my balcony, like these neon yellow eggplants\nand starfruit. I wonder what he can do with those!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
