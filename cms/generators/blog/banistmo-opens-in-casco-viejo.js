  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nA number of years, Arco surveyed among the neighbors what type of businesses they needed the most. Among them were: a pharmacy, a grocery store, a bank. Step by step, we´ve been bringing them to the neighborhood.  Not always an easy task! That is why we would like to celebrate today another historic landmark: Casco´s first bank in San Felipe. I don´t think the town had one since the 70´s.\nBanistmo opened this week at Casa Lewis, Plaza Herrera, corner of 9th and A Avenue. They´ll be open from Monday to Friday (9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.) and Saturdays (9 a.m. to 12 noon.). More info at their Facebook Page HERE\nWelcome!\n \n&nbsp;\n",
