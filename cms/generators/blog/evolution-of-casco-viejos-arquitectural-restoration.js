Before that, there were maybe a couple of restoration projects. By 1998 a number of them came along creating the first big push. the map shows the areas where this started to happen.  Through time, it is interesting to see not only the growing number of projects, but also how the &#8220;frontier line&#8221; of what was considered &#8220;safe&#8221; or even considered &#8220;Casco&#8221; began to move.\nToday, with more than 20 projects under construction at the same time, the private sector is stronger than ever.  They are providing not only with a varied number of projects including hotels, residential and commercial, but also with social programs, job creation for the locals and support to community activities. They are becoming the voice of continuity, the heart of the economic momentum in Casco Viejo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n",
