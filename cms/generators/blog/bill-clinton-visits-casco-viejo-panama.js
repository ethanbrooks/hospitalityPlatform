  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nReal Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama`s Historic District\n&nbsp;\nUS former President Bill Clinton was seen this past week roaming the streets of Casco Viejo, Panama`s 300 year old colonial city. Under the Panamanian tropical sun, and wearing a &#8220;Panama Hat&#8221;, orange polo shirt and kaki pants, Clinton enjoyed restaurants and bought handcrafts. He came to Panama to give a conference called &#8220;Embracing our common humanity&#8221; and during his brief time in our country he visited two sites: the Panama Canal and Casco Antiguo.\nDoesn`t that says it all?\nCasco Antiguo has become one of the leading tourism attractions of Panama. The second most visited site in Panama City, it stands between the main brands Panama has to offer to compete at an international level for tourism.  The first one being the Panama Canal.\nDuring his speech, Clinton highlighted how today`s world faces tremendous challenges towards the environment, reduction of poverty and economic revitalization.  In Casco Antiguo, an interesting model has been developed in the  last five years where the private sector has invested heavily in social programs at the same time that it has developed the local architecture.  As a result, the historic city has become one of the safest parts of town and has positioned itself not only as the second tourism destination of Panama City but also as Panama`s cultural axis.\nWhile there is still much left to be done,  and much of the work might not become apparent to the visitor (that didn´t know the area before)  the Casco has started to become an example for other communities within Panama and even small towns in countries such as Colombia.\nFor now, we are just happy Mr. Clinton passed by and enjoyed our neighborhood and hope he twitters a lot of friends about his visit!\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
