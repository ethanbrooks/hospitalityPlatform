Amazing.\n \nBack from PRISMA, I realize it is the &#8220;Lobato Day&#8221; for the Scouts, the whole gang is gathered by the basketball field at Santa Familia doing activities and games to celebrate. Children everywhere.\n\nSunday: wake up, walk the dog to Las Clementinas and have brunch there. They`ve started to offer on Sundays Venezuelan breakfast. Chef Paula is from Venezuela, and she missed her home made food, so she started cooking and the trend started growing. I`m an arepa fan, so we ordered Reina Pepiada and huevos pericos with caraotas (black beans).  After that, lazy Sunday took over, the perfect scenario to read and relax. I`m kind of sad I missed the Dog Fashion Show at Cinta Costera at 2 p.m.  Next time!\n \n",
