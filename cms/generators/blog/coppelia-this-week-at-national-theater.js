  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nEveryone who knows me knows I have a soft spot for ballet, specially good ballet and good ballet danced by friends. Last night, Coppelia checked all the boxes: choreography and direction by Russian and Czech`s masters Vasily Medvedev and Stanislav Feco, dance by my former troupe Panama`s National Ballet, female leading rol by friend and beautiful dancer Alexa Gutiérrez and male leading rol by former student of our ballet school, Solieh Samudio. I had a blast!\nThe production was well put together, a great one to take everyone in the family! so don´t miss the next nights, they are on until September 22nd. Tickets can be bought at Ticket Plus online, once you purchase, print the confirmation sheet and they`ll be waiting for you at the theater. Because the casts change every night, if you want to see Alexa again, she will be dancing on Thursday. Congratulations to everyone in the production!\nWhere to by tickets?
