The photos came out great!\nThe gallery`s concept is interesting: they`ll have affordable, interesting photography from good amateurs from around the world.  They will be able to carry professionals as well, but the idea is that visitors will be able to take home a quality gift at an affordable price.\nThey are located at the corner of Calle 1era and A Avenue and is run by Ingrid Moore (imoore@esquinaphoto.com). \nCongratulations!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
