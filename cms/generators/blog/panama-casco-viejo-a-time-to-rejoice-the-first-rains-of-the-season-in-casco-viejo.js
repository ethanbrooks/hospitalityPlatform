It is one of those books you get to read by the\n   same time you are reading The Little Prince and dreaming about flying to planets and\n   protect beautiful but arrogant roses or learn about life through a feathered friend.\n   \n\nThis morning it felt like a scene from Jonathan Livingston Seagull. The sky was a\nbeautiful plomb color, the air felt almost chilli. Hundreds of seagulls flying over\nthe roof catching all sorts of things for breakfast. A bit of rain still falling,\nbut not enough to carry an umbrella. We call that &#8220;bajareque&#8221;. I stood there, just\nwatching this silent, beautiful dance for a few minutes. It was really peaceful.\nI had this literature teacher (almost out of the Dead Poets Society movie) that said\nthat every day was beautiful no matter what and it had to be cherished. She would\nstorm into the classroom on a gloomy day like this (which I naturally enjoy, but others\nmay not) and ask us to write a poem in whatever style we might be studying at the\nmoment about the &#8220;beautiful day&#8221; we were living at. The idea was to appreciate each\nday for itself as each day had an inherit beauty that would never be really repeated.\nI remembered her this morning, while thinking about the seagulls, Jonathan Livingston\nand how lucky I felt to be here, now.\n\n\n\n",
