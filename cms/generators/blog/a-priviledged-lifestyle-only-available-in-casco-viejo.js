  "blog_article": "Last night I was sitting in a beautifully restored 300 year old church listening to sacred and Christmas music in a concert given by Musica Viva, a very well known Panamanian choir. It took me 6 minutes to walk from my office to the concert, which lasted an hour, and another 10 minutes to walk back home (I was so sleepy I was walking slowly).  No fuss, no traffic, and a great event in a unique hidden jewel of a colonial city. While sitting there, relaxing to the tones of Bach, Mozart and Scarlatti and humming cheerfully with Handel´s best seller (Hallelujah) I thought to myself: I´m so spoiled now! the world has only a few places where you can live this, all of them very special and in high demand. I feel so lucky to be here and live the revitalization of this wonderful town.\n",
