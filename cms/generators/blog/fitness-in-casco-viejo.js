She knows my alarm goes off at 6 a.m. but still starts stretching at 5:30 ish letting me know she won´t allow for a minute past 6 a.m. to go out.  Don´t get me wrong, I love working out in the mornings, but just in case there is ever a day I don´t want to do it&#8230; well, there is always Chispa.\nThis time I decided to take photos along the way, for those considering moving to Casco and asking themselves about gyms and options to keep fit. Most Casconians love to be outdoors.  In the morning, you see people walking Las Bovedas, but if you like jogging probably you`ll be heading to the Cinta.\n6:10 a.m. I`m ready, leach in hand with plenty of bags, we are out. First stop, the &#8220;cancha&#8221; by the Presidential palace. Already the Presidential police is having fun, playing soccer or sometimes basketball.\n\nSome of them have decided to work out at the Plaza V Centenario, right below.\nI was too early, but usually around 6:30 a.m. you can see some people practicing Tai Chi here\nFor those who like tenis, a small jog or 10 minute walk will warm you up:\n \nAnd for those who like light equipment, right next to the tenis field:\n\nComing back, you can always stop at the fish market and get fresh catch of the day.\n\n6:39 a.m., after walking, jogging and dragging my dog &#8230;I`m back at Calle 4ta.  Enough cardio, it is time to get serious. TLG Gym is at the end of the street, into the Santa Familia building.  Here John has a crossfit training for the morning and also does personal training. No machines and no need for them!  Kettlebells, weights, strings, ropes, medicine balls, boxing and jiu jitsu equipment.  Twenty minutes of any of that and you have earned your breakfast!\n \n&nbsp;\n",
