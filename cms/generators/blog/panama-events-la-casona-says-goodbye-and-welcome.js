  "blog_article": " Panama, Casco Viejo\nCasco Antiguo, Plaza Herrera\nFor the last two years, La Casona de las Brujas has been the center of the Panamanian bohemian scene. The space located at the old Maria Imaculada School near Plaza Herrera served as art gallery, concert hall, disco, art school for local children and just the favorite afterhours neighborhood hang out. \nA little bit like gypsies, La Casona model is based on &#8220;opening&#8221; spaces in unrestored buildings until they are up for restoration, giving the building life and sometimes breaking into areas that aren´t well known. Two years ago, Plaza Herrera was considered dangerous and undesirable. La Casona opened the eyes of young and not so young until it was synonim of Casco Viejo. This year, the building of La Inmaculada will be restored, and therefore la Casona has closed its doors there&#8230; only to open them again almost next door!\nThis time at the iconic City Bank, right on the other side of the Plaza. So don´t fear! the party will still go on&#8230;\nHere are some images of last night´s party. A great performance from the band Reggae Roots!\nThanks girls! keep up the good work&#8230;\n \n",
