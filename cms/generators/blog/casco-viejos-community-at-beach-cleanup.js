At least over 600 plastic bottles, two bags of broken foam, ten bags of miscellaneous plastic items, two bags of shoes (brands?&#8230;well, that would be the next thing to point out in a beach cleaning!), one full bag of bottle caps, one bag of clothing and at least another ten bags of general garbage.  Between the most curious objects they counted one fire extinguisher, a bed frame and a plastic toy in the shape of a foot.\nSweaty from head to toe, the end result was amazing:  a clean beach to enjoy. Immediately, a softball game was in place, and children and adults ran everywhere.\n\n",
