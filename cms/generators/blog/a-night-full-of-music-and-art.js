  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nLast night, Casco Viejo was full of great activities! free concerts at Plaza Catedral and Plaza V Centenario for completely different reasons: the celebration of Panama´s Red Cross 100 years and the celebration of Great! Britain´s week.  Panama is now sister city with Liverpool, so the event included a movie and music by the Beatles. Amazing cocktails!\nThe Red Cross event had its own celebrities: the family of Lady Mallet, who founded Red Cross in Panama assisted. There is even a building in Casco called Casa Mallet, as per its original owner.\nFinally, we had a blast going to Cine Animal at Temporal, where they were showing the art work of Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker. For the first time, all of their videos were shown together in a retrospective from 2006 to 2014.  They have one called &#8220;Domino Effect&#8221; filmed in Casco, our favorite. But their themes go from the environment to financial and cultural. Go check it out!\n            \n&nbsp;\n",
