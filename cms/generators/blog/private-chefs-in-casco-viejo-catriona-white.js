Voilà!\nHere is her contact info:\ncatrionacwhite@gmail.com\nPrivate Chef\nMiniHaha Gourmet\n61177450\nFACEBOOK PAGE HERE\nand here is a sample of what her options look like:\nQuinoa salad with oranges, pistachios, watercress and goat cheese, with optional chicken or prosciutto\nLime and coconut marinated chicken or salmon, yuzu carrot pure, sesame brown rice\nZucchini and feta fritters with minted bulgar wheat   and tahini dressing, optional lemon scented chicken or prawns\nPulled pork tacos with spicy slaw and stewed black beans\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
