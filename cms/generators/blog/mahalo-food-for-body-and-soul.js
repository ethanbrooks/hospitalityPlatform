In Hawaiian it means &#8221; thanks, gratitude, admiration, praise, esteem, regards, or respects&#8221;.  Now we have our own Casco style &#8220;Mahalo&#8221;, located on A Avenue, next to UnderCover boots, right after 5th and A, by Madrigal. Yes, we do give a lot of landmarks, that´s how our system works!\nLast night´s soft opening had a really good vibe. Mahalo will offer fresh food, pilates and yoga classes.  They´ll be offering deconstructed sushi, burritos, and salads to go. Soft spot for me: they´ll give you the jars, so you can bring them back and refill. Less waste! love it.\nThey also have cold press juices, and sauces made by chef José Carles from Donde José. The food is perfect for a healthy breakfast and lunch, for dinner they´ll also offer tapas, beer and wine.  The garden at the back is a really nice hang out.\nWelcome Mahalo!\n     \n",
