The plans include a visitor center at the old Casa del Arte for $1.7 million (with a $600,000 contribution from the Spanish Agency of International Cooperation / AECI) , and the restoration of all the lighting system ($4.3 millions).  The lighting project should start in 2011.\nThey are also hoping to start the restoration of the roofs of several churches, such as La Merced, which has recently restored one of the oldest &#8220;capillas&#8221; in Casco through private donations.\nAlthough the article wasn´t clear whether the full amount was already funded (or still in fundraising)  and planned to be invested in 2011 or if there was already an existing chronogram by stages showing what/ where/ when the works would get started, this publication is a positive step towards the right direction, specially after UNESCO`s visit last month where some of the issues related to infrastructure were discussed.\n",
