Story telling is powerful.\nThis week, Casco´s Play Group started a story telling activity at Casco´s bookstore café, Papaya Planet.  Initially,  kids will meet twice a month, around 4:30 p.m. and stories will be read in both Spanish and English. Maybe more languages, depending on volunteers!!! if you would like to join the group, let us know!\nHere are some photos of the adorable first reading.
