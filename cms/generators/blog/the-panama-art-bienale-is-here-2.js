Wiseman has been acknowledged over the past three decades as\n   one of the most important filmmakers in the United States.\n\nBrooke Alfaro: Recent Paintings\n\n\n   Within the framework of the Biennial, Panama’s well known artist Brooke Alfaro will\n   present, for the first time in several years, an exhibition of his paintings.\n\n\n   Brooke Alfaro (Panama 1949) graduated in 1976 as an architect from the University\n   of Panama. He studied painting at the Art Students League in New York from 1980 to\n   1983. Since the early 1990s, his painting evolved from a technique close to the classical\n   masters towards a radical transformation in form with the aim not only of manipulating\n   pictorial space, but of expressing specific spiritual and psychological states. Both\n   in his paintings and his videos (a medium he has worked in since 1999), a major part\n   has been played by Alfaro’s humble neighbors from the historic area of San Felipe,\n   where the artist used to live and continues to visit. In both genres, he employs a\n   caustic sense of humor and deceptive jokes that subvert the possible interpretations\n   of his artwork. (A.Samos)\n\nACTIVITIES IN 2007\n\n   Educational Workshops about Contemporary Art Practices\n\n\n   The 8th Biennial will develop, during 2007 and 2008, a program of educational activities\n   directed at compensating, at least in part, for the lack of opportunities available\n   for learning about contemporary art in Panama. A total of 35 participants took part\n   in the two workshops carried out in 2007, including artists, art professors, and others\n   interested in improving their artistic education. The workshops were:\n\n\n\n   • Art Photography Appreciation Workshop. A one-week course\n   on the theory and history of photography, with the participation of fifteen artists,\n   taught by well-known Panamanian artist and photographer Rachelle Mozman.\n\n\n   • Seminar: “Reflections on contemporary Art”. A one-week\n   course on the theory and history of contemporary art, with the participation of twenty\n   artists and art professors, taught by Saidel Brito, Academic Coordinator of the prestigious\n   Instituto Superior Tecnológico de Artes del Ecuador (ITAE), located in Guayaquil.\n\n\n\n   Premiere presentation of the documentary Curundú by Ana Endara\n\n\n   Produced between 2006 and 2007, with the sponsorship of the Fondo de Fomento al Audiovisual\n   de Centroamérica y el Caribe, Curundú is the opera prima of young Panamanian filmmaker\n   Ana Endara. Its premiere and a round table discussion about the film were held on\n   the 4th of December 2007 at the historic Ancon Theater Guild. Kenneth, the main character,\n   is a charismatic figure who earns his living by taking pictures of his neighbors in\n   Curundú, an overpopulated and precarious community, located not too far from the historic\n   center of Panama City, on the edge of the former Canal Zone. The documentary speaks\n   to us about Curundú through Kenneth and his photos.\n\n\n",
