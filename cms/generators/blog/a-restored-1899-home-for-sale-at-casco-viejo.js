  "blog_article": "One of the things I enjoy the most in Casco Viejo is the fact that each home is truly different from the one next to it. There are no identical twins here, no &#8220;copy &#8211; paste&#8221; and each one has a history of its own.\nCasa Vidal  , our featured home for sale, is the perfect example. The first public deed of the house dates from August 12th, 1899 and certifies that the owner was Doña Teresa Arosemena de Vidal, known as the Widow Vidal.  Back then, Panama was not even Panama, but the &#8220;isthmus&#8221; of Panama and it belonged to Colombia!\nToday, Casa Vidal has been developed into one of the few Casco Viejo`s single family townhouse.  The contrast between the house`s Caribbean style upper facade with the heavier groundfloor made out of colonial stone and carved in a French style illustrates the architectural eclecticism for which Casco Antiguo is known.\nAbandoned for nearly half a century, Casa Vidal`s stone and mortar ground floor stood strong, but her wooden fasade and structure needed to be completely rebuilt. This provided the design team with the opportunity to take advantage of the interior`s great volumes and natural light.  The double height living room brings a special feeling to the main area, while the thickness of the walls bring a cozy, intimate feeling to the house.\nThe master bedroom allows privacy, light and cross ventilation. Casa Vidal`s ground floor opens onto a walled garden, providing the opportunity for a private den, office or guest bedroom.\nBut without a doubt, Casa Vidal`s most unusual features is the rooftop deck with its plunge pool and stunning views of Panama City, the Pacific Ocean and the Paseo Esteban Huertas.\nPrice: $860,000\nArea: 376.16 mt2\n3 Bedrooms, 3 1/2 Bathrooms\n(Under Construction)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
