Open spaces and gardens that show all the textures of charming Casco Viejo.  Spaces like this open golden opportunities for locals to develop their ideas and grow with the neighborhood. We encourage more owners to open up their unrestored buildings and keep providing the neighborhood with such interesting places!\nCongratulations to La Vecindad!\n[slideshow] \n",
