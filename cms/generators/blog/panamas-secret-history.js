We`ve been trying to find out if they have it in English, but seems that they didn`t.\nSo, if you speak Spanish, take a look, it is a really well done show.  If you don`t,  we can still give you one great &#8220;secret&#8221; story to read about: did you know back during the Gold Rush it was a Texas Ranger who was called in to Panama to &#8220;put order&#8221; in town?
