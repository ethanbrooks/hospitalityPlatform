  "blog_article": " \nCasco Antiguo, San Felipe\n\nA new business has opened in Casco Antiguo! It is called &#8220;Indigo&#8221;, an oriental-mediterranean fusion restaurant between 2nd and 3rd street in Central Avenue. Just by the side of the Tourism Police and next to the restaurant Manolo Caracol. They are still on their soft opening week, but Clara and I had the best passion fruit ceviche and some fantastic Greek empanadas with goat cheese and a sundried tomato sweet sauce. The ambiance is mostly Indian mixed with Moroccan, the decoration has lounge spaces to relax, and a bar area and more formal seating if you want to have dinner.\n\nBut the best spot is the back patio. Al fresco dinning with the possibility to extend into the Arco Chato ruins, as it has a door connecting the patio with the historical monument. They can arrange for dinners and small private events at the back of Arco Chato.\n\nTalking to Fernando and Katherine, two of the owners of the restaurant, they tell us they can host seating dinners up to 75 people. Cocktails, they can manage so far about a 115. But being able to offer the charm of Arco Chato and the convenience of indoor seating for an event&#8230; priceless!\nContact them at: 228-1822  indigo@indigopanama.com\n",
