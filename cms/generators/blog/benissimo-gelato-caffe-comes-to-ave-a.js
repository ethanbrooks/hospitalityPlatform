Bits of coconut are there down to the last lick.  Besides gelato, choose from their bacon mozzarella waffle or waffle with nutella con banano accompanied by  a cappuccino.  On Saturday, I dropped in for a panini de pavo as more than 100 assorted motorcycles roared through the Casco. Stop by, introduce yourself to Jose Manuel and his staff.\n\n",
