  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo &#8211; Casco Antiguo, San Felipe\nA new client recently asked me “Is Casco Viejo gay friendly?”  For a moment I had to think about the question. You see, growing up as a ballet dancer I never even gave a thought to it.  Half of the male dancers were gay, although probably we didn’t have any lesbians back then. We used to base from the National Theatre at Casco Viejo, and although we only stayed there for a couple of years it was simply delightful.   \nI was a teenager back then, so I didn’t really noticed why Casco Antiguo was so enjoyable. I could point out to my background as my family lived here and obviously felt a connection but it wasn’t only that. It is the fact that everyone can be whatever they want to be here and no one thinks about it twice. It is so densely diverse (both architecturally and socially) that adding another color to this already bright palette is the natural thing to do, it makes it more interesting and cheerful; so you are never out of tone. You are part of the tone. \nSomehow, Casco Viejo as a city feels so good in its own skin that it just embraces the entire rainbow of options. Bars like La Casona or Baños Publicos have become the classic hang out spot for artists of all sorts and even those who (like me) can’t paint a rainbow but still have a bohemian, adventurous soul.  \nIf you are wondering about how nightlife is here, check out my reviews and explore! \nWhat to do? Restaurants, bars, theatres \nEgo &amp; Narciso: One beside the other at Plaza Bolivar. Wonderful Peruvian tapas at Ego and very good italian food at Narciso.
