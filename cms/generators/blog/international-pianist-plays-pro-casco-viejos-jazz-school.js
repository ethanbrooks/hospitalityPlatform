Today, their best &#8220;kids&#8221; play in Boston with the Berklee Global Jazz  Institute. And this year, for the first time, one of their students will  complete the cycle which started when he was 13 years old: he is moving from being a student and a performer to a teacher.   In the  years to come, their first full graduation will be doing the same, coming back to Panamá to help others like them break the cycle of poverty through first class music education.\nThumbs up to the Danilo Perez Foundation and everyone supporting their amazing work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n",
