Other AVACA members present on Sunday helping with the workshop were Blanca Dávalos, Mitchelle Quiñones, Ivana Rabbat and Jennifer Hotsko.  Irving De La Rosa and Faustino Romero were in charge of picking up material during the week and sorting it out.\nThe most important part of this effort is that AVACA`s team is considering promoting recycling as part of their &#8220;garbage committee&#8221; programs. We are excited about what will be their next step!\nMore on AVACA HERE \nFollow AVACA on Facebook HERE\nMore on Sembrarte HERE\ninstead of this&#8230;.\n\nMore of this!
