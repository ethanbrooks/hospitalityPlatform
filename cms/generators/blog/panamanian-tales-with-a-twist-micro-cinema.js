The star film of the night was Cucarachita Mandi, a twist on the Panamanian fable &#8220;La Cucarachita Mandinga&#8221;.  All the films, including Mandi, were based on animation. Temporal also showed what it takes to make it: all the props (which were for sale) and the amazing number of people involved to do it. My favorite voice character was by Jaguar Clandestino, one of the really talented slam poets in Panama.  He raps pretty well too!\nCongratulations to the Temporal team and to Valerie for keeping it up! last night was super fun!\n          \n",
