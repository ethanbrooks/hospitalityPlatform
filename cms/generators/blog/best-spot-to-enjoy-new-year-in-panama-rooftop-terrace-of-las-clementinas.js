  "blog_article": "Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo\n&nbsp;\nLast year, we had the pleasure of being at Las Clementinas for New Years. It was amazing, their rooftop terrace has almost a 360 degree view of Casco and Panama City. The city itself becomes your private firework show, from Paitilla to the Ghery Museum in Amador.\nThis year, Las Clementinas will open again its panoramic roof terrace.  Dinner will include a delicious menu featuring lobster and unlimited mimosas. It is the perfect spot if you don´t like crowds and prefer a more elegant, intimate ambiance.\nBy the way, the brunch the next day promises to be really yummy&#8230; see the menu at the photos attached.\nCall now!\nPh. 228-7613/ 7617\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
