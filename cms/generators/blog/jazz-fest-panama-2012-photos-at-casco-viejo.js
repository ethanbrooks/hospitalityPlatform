  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\n&nbsp;\nOn Saturday, Casco Viejo got flooded with wonderful music and music lovers.  Musicians included Tito Puente Jr, side by side with Panamanian students from the Danilo Perez Foundation.  When the festival started years ago (is it eight already?) they presented young talents that were just starting to receive education at the Foundation such as Milagros (see photo, already a teenager).  She must have been around five years old.   On Saturday, some of them already graduating, they presented a beautiful show along kids from well known music schools such as Berkley.\nWhat I love about it is its mellow ambiance: everyone &#8220;hanging out&#8221;, meeting people from literally everywhere, every corner of Panama and the World.   Congratulations ot the organizers! enjoy the photos&#8230;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
