  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo\nRemember jumping rope,  racing through car tires and doing balancing games on top of logs? These were some of the games that Eco Creando worked out last week with children from Aprojusan, mixed with a small art workshop where they learned how to turn plastic bottles into small jewelry boxes. In a world where everything is based on computer games and kids are less and less into physical activities,  I believe this is an important link to being a healthy kid and future balanced adult.\nThis is the kind of small stuff that happens every day here and that makes it so exciting. It is the sum of all of those volunteers and programs that are making the difference. Love it! Congratulations to Diana and all her friends from Eco Creando, and to Gio with her team from Aprojusan!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
