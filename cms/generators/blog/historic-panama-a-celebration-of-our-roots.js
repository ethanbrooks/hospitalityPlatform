And the street names are from Mr. Figueroa`s book on Panama`s history.\nEnjoy!\nCalle de Matadero (today Calle 13, means the Butcher`s street)\nCalle de las Damas (today Calle Colón, means Ladies street)\nCalle de la Chancleta ( a name from 1812&#8230; not sure if we have a straight translation. It is the plastic sandal that you can buy for $0.99 at any store. )\nCalle del Agua (Water Street)\nCalle Salsipuedes (still exists! Get Out if You Can)\nCallejón de Ahogapollos (DrownChickens Alley) &#8230;  my favorite!\n\n",
