Their pricing goes from $250 to $350 per night.  The restaurant downstairs is still on the works, but hopefully will open in the next few months.  Great wine selection, as the owners are also the owners of the well known Di Vino Enoteca at 5th Street.\nLovely work guys! congratulations!\nFor more information, contact ph.
