In a matter of hours, lists and donations were organized, by 6 a.m. on the following day a team was in place with tasks, headquarters and social media strategies.  It made me think a lot about Casco Viejo, and its true value. The value of a place is tied up to its community, to its ability to work together and get through difficult times when things get tough. Somehow this doesn´t make it to the &#8220;real estate&#8221; analysis, but it should, because striped from  high end finishes, double panned windows, nice facades and sidewalks, what really matters is the strength of the human web that not only connects physically in the same space and time&#8230; but feels connected to each other.\nThe strength of Casco are its Casconians. And note that by Casconians I mean every Casco lover out there, we are all connected, and this trial was the real proof of it: people came from everywhere to help. Thank you so much to each and every one of you. To the NGO`s who were coordinating and working their heads off: Aprojusan, Fundación Calicanto, AVACA. Amazing. To all the businesses that didn´t even flinch in pulling out their contacts and see who knew who so that we could get what we needed. Super Thumbs Up.  To all the volunteers &#8230; you rock!!!\n \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
