Ferenc Feher from Hungary had an interesting concept based on the Tao Te Ching about humans living in harmony. But it was the South Korean troupe that stole the night with Swan Lake, five swans losing their homes due to pollution, dying at the end of exhaustion. Tchaikovsky´s music had the perfect notes for everything: drama and comedy. But the end was done in silence, as it should be.\nWhat a performance! thanks so much to the Prisma Dance Festival! thumbs up!\n\n",
