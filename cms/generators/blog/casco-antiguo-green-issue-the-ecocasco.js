These ignored neighbors have a memory and rhythm of their own, and they are a vital part of Casco’s identity. With all the world’s climate issues, we would like to take this opportunity to get everyone thinking about a more sustainable Casco, an example to the rest of Panama City. The seeds are already getting planted&#8230; join us!  \n\nFrom Garbage to Garden Contest\n\nHere is the challenge: design a cheap, easy to build and good looking composting system (yes, we have to look good at all times). The winner will win not only a $100, but a place in our hearts but in our balconies and terraces.  The winning design will be used in a program in Casco Viejo to help build and sustain several organic gardens that will provide both good food and awareness about recycling. The rules of the contest are very simple and it is open to everyone, either living in Casco or not.To download the info, just click here: http://www.arcoproperties.com/images/Urbanposterfinal.jpgOr go to my homepage: www.arcoproperties.com. You´ll see a big logo on the right with a butterfly&#8230; just click there! and be sure to zoom the jpg.  Also, feel free to upload it in other websites, the more the merrier!\n\nLas Clementinas: Casco´s First Organic Garden \nClementinas is a small condo project in Casco Viejo with an organic garden at its heart. Already in the works, this wonderful spot will provide fresh vegetables to the restaurant at the commercial space below.\nThe building has 6 units with great views (water and plaza) and sustainable finishes such as wood floors made of reclaimed wood from Lake Gatun. Submerged for the last 100 years, it’s better than new! Conservatorio: our first nursery  \nA burst of exotic tropical species are growing in our backyard.These are the plants that will help us create the organic gardens in Clementinas and hopefully find their way on to your plates soon. If we’re lucky, they’ll spread into different community gardens throughout Casco. What is incredible about all the green stuff you see here is that 99% of it is edible. Leaves, fruits, flowers!  An explosion of different flavors, from chewy to spicy&#8230; Spencer Woodard can tell you all about it, click here to go to his Blog http://anthrome.wordpress.com  \n   Spread the seed&#8230;  tell a friend!  \n",
