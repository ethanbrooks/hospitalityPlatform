  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Antiguo\nCasco Viejo, San Felipe\n\nHere is an exciting project on the move: transforming Casco Antiguo into an organic\ngarden. Our friend and organic specialist Spencer Woodard is already working on it,\nand I have to say it´s fascinating. I love all green stuff, a tree hugger myself (I\nused to work for ANCON and then for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in\nPanama, plus all sorts of eco trips I do every now and then) I´m a great fan of turning\nanything green, but this friend of ours is really passionate about it.\nHis idea is to introduce in the parks at the plazas and other forgotten green areas\nsmall, designed, organic gardens. They could have themes as &#8220;exotic plants&#8221; or &#8220;edible\nleafs from Central America&#8221; or just serve as community gardens where to teach children\nabout nature and practical life. Well run, an organic garden could produce enough\nto balance the diet of a number of families, so I think it might be a good project\nfor the local community and a great example for other places to reproduce.\nHere are some pictures of the plants he already has ready. He had &#8220;saril&#8221; which is\na fruit we Panamanians love to use for &#8220;chicha&#8221; on Christmas. I´m not sure why not\nthe rest of the year, but traditionally this spicy and refreshing drink is only made\nin December. He also had a plant where the leaves are rich in Omega 3, for those who\nfollow the last discoveries in nutrition and health, apparently Omega 3 is important\nfor your general wellbeing. All grown in a backyard! It could even be arranged for\nmost of this to grow on a balcony.\nIn no particular order, here are some shots of his &#8220;vivero&#8221;&#8230;\n\n\n",
