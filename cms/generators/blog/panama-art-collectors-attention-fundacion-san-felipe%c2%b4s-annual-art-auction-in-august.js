  "blog_article": " Panama, Casco Antiguo\nCasco Viejo, San Felipe\n\nWe received a flash note from Quintessentially announcing their next &#8220;Silent Auction&#8221; of Fundacion San Felipe. This year, the 17th one, it will be held at the Marriott hotel, and all proceeds will go to their various programs ranging from art to photography for kids. This is usually a good place to get mostly Latinamerican Art.\nThere isn´t much in the internet about the Foundation, however, they´ve been in the area  for quite a while, working with children and taking care of the restoration of the San Felipe Neri church, which was their flag project, and now serves as headquarters for most of their programs.\nThe auction will be August 12th, and you can get the tickets through Quintessentially: qpanama@quintessentially.com\nHere is a picture of photographer Francisco Bech and his class. Francisco has been collaborating every summer with the Foundation for the last 3 years providing a photograph course for free to children in the area.\n\n",
