The hotel was rebuilt and opened again in 1884. The new hotel boasts all of 19th century Europeanizing modernity.\nThe most striking element of the hotel was the interior courtyard &#171;The Palm Garden&#187;, it was a tourist attraction and the meeting point of that time.\nIn 1894 the hotel was purchased by Henry Ehrman who restored it to become one of the most elegant buildings of the city in the late 20th century.\nOn November 3, 1903, the Revolutionary Council chose the Central Hotel as their office and provisional headquarters, to establish military control and various defense strategies.\nCurrently the building was restored and continues its history as a Hotel.
