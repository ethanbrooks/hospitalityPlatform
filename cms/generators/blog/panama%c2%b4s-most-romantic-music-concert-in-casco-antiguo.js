It was the perfect concert for a laid back Saturday: a group of Panamanian authors (and a Spanish guy named Jesus Garriga, from Canarias) singing their own songs with a guitar. It was the perfect romantic, sweet, cuddle-up-with-your-best-half concert of the year. Somehow, it had a good crowd, even if half of Panama was really at the Juanes Concert at Amador. Somehow I took this fantastic photo with my phone camera, I still don´t know how I did it&#8230; enjoy!\n\n",
