Had great gnocci and some vodka pesto pasta at Narciso. Some of our Australian friends who just came back from a surf weekend at Bocas del Toro where at the table next to us.  Jorge, the owner came out to say hi and chat about the latest neighborhood news. Some French bohemian musicians passed by with their flutes and played for a couple of minutes. White and red wine&#8230; and ready to go back home!  As we strolled back, we played with our dog in one of the small parks.\nCasco Antiguo relaxing evening\nCasco Antiguo lifestyle is just like that. And we love it.\n",
