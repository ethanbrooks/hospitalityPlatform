Ducret, Alvin, Sombra, Pichuli and Javier.  The guys seemed to be truly enjoying themselves pretending to be thieves, victims and opposing gang members; who knows, maybe we have some potential homegrown acting talent here in the Casco.\nIn addition to the music video, Nico says that they are working on starting another longer video that will also focus on the consequences of violence in the neighborhood.  To see former gang members dedicate themselves to these videos makes me proud to be a part of the Casco revitalization process.\nPD\n\n\n\n\n",
