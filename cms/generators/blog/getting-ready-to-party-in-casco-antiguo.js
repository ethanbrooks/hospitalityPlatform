Big month, in fact.  November is known as Panama´s &#8220;vacation month&#8221; since it has tons of Patriot holidays.  After  Halloween (well, this is not a Patriot Holiday as you may have guessed) we have: Day of the Dead (or of All Saints) on November 2nd, celebration of our Separation from Colombia (Nov. 3rd), Flag Day (4th), Colon`s Day (5th), Los Santos Independence Scream (10th)and our Independence from Spain (28th).  Then  comes December with Children`s Day, Teacher`s Day, Mother`s Day, and of course Christmas. But one decoration at a time!\nLike little ants, government workers are dressing up buildings, businesses are rushing through the last party permits and people squeeze themselves at Salsipuedes (Panama`s most famous bargain hall at Santa Ana in Casco Viejo) hoping to get the right size polleras, montunos and accessories for their children who are probably participating in a school parade during the holidays.  It was so tight at Salsipuedes that I could barely get my camera out! Literally &#8220;get out if you can&#8221;.\nBy the way&#8230; if you are in Casco, don`t miss the Zombie Walk! Everyone at Plaza Herrera at 9 p.m.\n\n",
