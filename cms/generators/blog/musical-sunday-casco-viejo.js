  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nA classic Casco Viejo Sunday: walk my dog early around 7 ish, and down the street two neighbors singing and dancing.  They were so funny improvising I had to take a video and upload it to Facebook. But then, in the afternoon, a friend called me &#8220;hey! concert in Plaza Catedral,!&#8221;. So I run there and a group of students from La Chorrera had their band playing. After, the SPI band followed with tons of salsa, and the whole plaza became a dancing floor. The kids were fantastic, their spirit got contagious, everyone started dancing after them. \nAnd you know what is the best about this? that this type of stuff happens all the time here. You wouldn´t be able to plan ahead for this. You can only live it by living in it. Awesome.\n  \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
