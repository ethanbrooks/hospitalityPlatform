The apartments are quite spacious, specially the living rooms! \nRecords show that the original house was built in 1917.  However, when they started digging, they found a  piece of a &#8220;Hornabeque&#8221;.  An Hornabeque in Spanish is a defensive system that offshore colonial cities used to build back in 1765 &#8211; 1769.  This one was designed by Colonel Manuel Hernandez, who was sent to the Americas by King Charles III in 1759 to reinforce the security of the back then fortified Panama City. The piece of this wall is shown through a glass floor, and is a witness of a time where this area was nothing but flatland &#8230; and a wall. \nThe apartments are beautiful and will not be for sale&#8230; only for rent! While the area is in transition, you`ll be neighbors with the Danilo Perez jazz foundation and Olga Sinclair`s brand new art foundation. Last floor has great water views!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
