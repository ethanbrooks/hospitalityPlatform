Located at the corner of 4th and Central, the house currently belongs to the government, but we are glad to announce that finally it has been given to the Olga Sinclair Foundation to run it.\nDownstairs, a lovely café offers lunch (delicious paella on Thursdays!) surrounded by art pieces from different local artists. Upstairs, a space for events and itinerary art shows. Right now, until October 14th, there is an interesting show of Panama`s Young Architects (JAP, in Spanish Jóvenes Arquitectos de Panamá).\nWe love having new spaces for art open in Casco!\n      \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
