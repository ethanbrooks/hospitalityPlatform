  "blog_article": "Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo\nWelcome Casa Nuratti! right next to Tantalo, this is a spot for the young soul. The design concept brings hip and recycling together in a fresh, young look and feel.  Art hidden in every corner: from photos and crafts from local artists to a a tribute to Blek Le Rat, the graffiti French artist who back in the 50`s invented the &#8220;stencil graffiti&#8221; concept.  You`ll enjoy Nuratti, but specially the roof terrace bar which has a small pool to freshen up. Will it be open to more than guests? I still have to ask!\nMy favorite part was the thought put up on every room door. Each one is identified with a phrase that opens a question or a riddle that hints you into different parts of Panamanian culture and geography.\nCongratulations guys!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
