Each Saturday, they gather at Santa Familia in Calle 4ta and address issues that go from opening a bank account to discipline and family.\nYou would probably think, well, nothing extraordinary about that. But don`t take anything for granted. The Scouts work with kids that come from the poorest areas in Panama, some with extreme family issues and for the Casco they`ve helped break the cycle of violence by nurturing children with self esteem, values and fair play.\nOn Sunday, Panama`s Scouts Association celebrated San Francis of Asis day, which is the patron of the Lobatos (the youngest group at the Scouts).  Casco Viejo kids had the opportunity to join Scouts from all over Panama and had a blast. I have to say I was moved, to see them dancing, singing and enjoying themselves. But above all, I was impressed with the quality of the leaders who were true teachers, true parents.\nHats off to the Scouts!\n\n",
