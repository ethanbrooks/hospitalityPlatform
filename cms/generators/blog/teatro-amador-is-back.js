  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo, Santa Ana\nTeatro Amador is a beautiful theater located in Santa Ana, just after the traffic light.  It always caught my imagination because of my father`s stories about his childhood. He used to go there to watch movies (at some point it was both theater and movie theater), specially Flash Gordon. For $0.15 a day, you could stay there for hours, because first would be the news, then a raffle or similar and finally the movie. \nFinally, the theater has been restored and it is breaking several marks in one: it is the first privately restored theater and the first renovated building in Santa Ana, marking a new era for the area. \nThis Friday, the soft opening will be dedicated to Casco Viejo`s neighbors, specially members of the AVACA group.  We are glad to see new and interesting concepts entering the area, and very specially history being brought back!\nNeedless to say&#8230;. I`m taking dad to the opening! canÂ´t wait!!! \n\n",
