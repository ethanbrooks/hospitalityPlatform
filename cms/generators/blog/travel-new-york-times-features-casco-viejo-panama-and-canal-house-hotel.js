  "blog_article": "Panama, Casco Viejo\nCasco Antiguo, San Felipe\n&#8220;A Cultural Cornerstone&#8221; is today´s New York Times travel article about Casco Viejo, Panama, featuring our favorite hotel Canal House Panama as editor´s pick and businesses like Karavan Gallery and Indigo Restaurant. Check out the article HERE . \nI believe travel journalists in New York Times understand very well today´s traveler who looks for an authentic place, an experience that has both a level of sophistication but yet is at the same time unpolished. Just like the article cites Cuba, Casco Antiguo in Panama shares common architectural styles and cultural characteristics. Plus&#8230; it is legal! and for real estate, it is cheaper than any of its revitalized peers in the region.\nBut frankly, the best is to live here. Why? the international airport is 20 minutes away and COPA is a fantastic airline that takes me to most destinations I want to go to. Internet connection is great, the neighborhood is beautiful, cost of living is better than in the States so I can afford a maid (I´m sure others would include a cook and or a chofer) and the community is interesting. You can make a positive impact here. On the weather, Casco Viejo´s old stones receive sun all year round and rain half of the year but only for an hour at a time and once a day. At night, I walk out to have good dinner and / or have a Zacapa rhum at one of the neighborhood bars. Or if there´s an event going on, I just walk there and back. Like last night, there was a rock concert at Plaza Herrera, 7 minutes away by feet. And if I want more of a modern city flavor&#8230; well, I just get my car and drive less than 15 minutes. I´m right into Panama´s nightlife district. Although I have to warn you, as a friend told me last night: why would I ever leave Casco Viejo? everything happens right here&#8230;  \nCasco Antiguo Music Concert at Plaza Herrera\n",
