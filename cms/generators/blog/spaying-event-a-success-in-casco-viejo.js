When you meet her, you know immediately you are in front of a non nonsense person with a deep commitment to the cause.

The event was amazing, and it benefited neighbors that otherwise wouldnÂ´t have had the means to operate their pets.\nThe event was held at the Santa Familia Community Center, at the space facilitated by Top Level Gym  Congratulations to everyone involved in this wonderful event!\nIf you would like to donate to Spay Panama, please contact them HERE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
