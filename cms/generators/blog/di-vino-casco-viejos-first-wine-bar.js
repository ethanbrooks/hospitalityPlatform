A beautiful wine bar is opening right in front of Arco Properties office at Casco Viejo, Panama.   I confess myself to be a cheese fanatic, and Di Vino (which means &#8220;divine&#8221; in Spanish, but in Italian means &#8220;about wine&#8221;) has not only a wonderful ambiance but great cheeses and &#8211; of course- wines.  Italian wines, to be more specific, as Di Vino belongs to three good Italian friends (Milan, Rome) and Casco Viejo neighbors: Denis, Jacopo and Francesco.\nBuilt with great taste and using wood and glass, you`ll enjoy hanging out there. And if after a couple of good Chianti you feel like buying real estate&#8230; just crawl to the building in front and visit us!!!!\nFor more on what to do in Casco Viejo or where to go, click here. \n\n",
