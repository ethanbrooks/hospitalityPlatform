Casco gets pretty quiet, but if you walk to Central Avenue, you´ll see everyone buzzing, buying lottery tickets, hats, wigs and food, getting ready for the weekend and the parades.  Salsipuedes also has a traditional sale of school books, as the school calendar starts right after carnivals. We prefer to avoid the big party at Cinta Costera, if you are in Panama city, do explore Central Avenue or head to the beaches, specially Taboga or anywhere in the Pearl Islands.  Traffic to the countryside might be a challenge! if you do go that way, make sure to pack your patience!\n      \n",
