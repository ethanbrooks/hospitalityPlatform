From the beautiful to the truly bizarre! last week walking by the beach nearby the old Club Union I bumped into this broken fishing boat. Chispa went bananas smelling everything like crazy, going in and out, scratchin`sniffin`.  It must have lost its anchor at high tide and then destroyed bumping against the wide rock bed.  Nature has its ways! I thought about how curious it looked clashing against the big buildings at the back. This little fishing boat in many ways recalled images of an almost lost way of living for urban creatures who (like me) pretty much  think fish comes from the supermarket.   How fragile our perception of civilization is and how incredible to bump into this here and now.\nYes, it is 5 p.m. and I need some serious sugar bust.\n[slideshow] \n",
