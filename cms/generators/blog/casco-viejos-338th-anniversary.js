Most of the activities will be held at Casa de la Cultura with seminars and talks about preservation.  The Canal Museum will hold a conference on the 18th (today) at 10 a.m. about the tourism influence of the Casco Antiguo and at 11:45 a.m. Dra. Katty Osorio will talk about the &#8220;Moving of the City and Continuity at Panama Vieja&#8221;.\nTomorrow, January 19th, the Canal Museum will have two conferences: 10 a.m. about urban planning and &#8220;museum &amp; Casco Viejo&#8221;.    As an interactive activity, they are are asking participants to bring newspaper cuttings which will be gathered in a &#8220;time chest&#8221; and closed to be open in 10 years.  Hope they keep it in the Canal Museum!\n[slideshow] \n",
