They can´t help it! And this was the case of the Harlem Quartet. They were so much fun backstage, making jokes, always with a smile.  I had never listened to their work, so I was wondering how it would be. They came out&#8230; and had a blast! the audience enjoyed every fun piece executed both with mastery and great spirits. No wonder one of their main activities is education.  To be a great teacher you have to know how to capture your audience and keep them with you&#8230; and boy did they know!fantastic.\nThere was also the abstract piece by the Conservatorio de Paris, directed by Riccardo Del Fra. Let`s face it: jazz sometimes can get into some imaginative lands! these guys were as creative as it could get, I don`t think I`ve ever seen the trumpet being played like this before.\nAnd finally&#8230; but not least important, the Vitín Paz performance with his Big Band.It was amazing to see him play, seating elegantly with his tall hat.  And the kids at the band were playing at their best, sharing the scene with seasoned international artists. Danilo Pérez himself was smiling, dancing on and off stage. The night ended (for us!) around 11 p.m.  But the gang was fired up with energy&#8230; straight to a jam session that lasted (I`m sure) till 1 a.m. !\nPanama Jazz Fest\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
