Outside my office I heard this really loud noise, children screaming laughing and things falling down, stumbling. I went out and the APROJUSAN kids where playing &#8220;congelada&#8221; (frozen) and it was to die for.  I really can´t remember the last time I played it, but I do remember having tons of fun with it.\nBasically, someone is &#8220;it&#8221; and if he/she touches you, then you are frozen. You can be &#8220;defrosted&#8221; by a friend that runs and touches you, and there are &#8220;havens&#8221; (determined in advance) where &#8220;it&#8221; can´t reach you. The game allows for &#8220;chains&#8221; which are made by children holding hands, one touching the &#8220;haven&#8221; and the idea is to reach a &#8220;frozen&#8221; one to &#8220;defrost&#8221; him in a safe way. I loved it because it quickly makes kids run like crazy, work in a team, focus on a goal and make the best to &#8220;save&#8221; their friend.  What could be better!!! In the meantime, it is all chaos&#8230; fantastic. At the end, kids where exhausted, sweating, smiling, rushed with endorphins.  As healthy kids should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
