  "blog_article": "I always joke about it, but the thing about the joke is that it has a big chunk of truth to it: I basically got most of my English watching Sesame Street and singing heavy metal songs.   In retrospective I should add: and going to the movies. Why? because I loved comparing the English words to the subtitles and catching translation errors. Also, the different accents where fascinating, along with the fact that &#8220;F&#8221; word got translated mostly as &#8220;carajo&#8221;, which I personally think is quite funny.\nNot sure if Casco Viejo is ready for it´s first video store: Cinema Paradiso. But I´m sure everyone here will appreciate it! the collection is quite eclectic, but it will help the growing number of foreigners to practice their Spanish right at home while having fun.\nSo welcome Rainer and Eyhaes! the video has also internet services and it is located in front of the Art Deco building, at A Avenue, between 4th and 5th.\n",
