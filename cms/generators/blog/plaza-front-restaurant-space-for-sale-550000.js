  "blog_article": "\nIn Casco Antiguo, it is very rare when a plaza front commercial space  is for sale.  If you are an investor looking for prime income property, this could be it. P.H. Montefiori was the first building on Plaza Herrera to be restored (2008), followed by P.H. Casa de la Merced in 2010.  Construction on two hotels is scheduled to start this year.  The current tenant is a popular restaurant.  Designed to be an intimate space, the 172m2 consists of a main dining/bar area, an interior patio and mezzanine where the kitchen is currently located. For more information, contact Patrizia or Clara at Arco Properties.\n \n\n\n\n\n",
