Hotel Colombia is well known for it`s beautiful roof terrace and pool. This apartment is partially furnished and has parking!\n\nCasa Arias: this is groundfloor commercial available for retail. No restaurants nor bars! great for any other use. We would love to see something artistic in this space, as the house has such character. The patio at the back is not part of the space, although it can be used from time to time for special things, provided that it doesnÂ´t disturb the tenants in the building.\n\n",
