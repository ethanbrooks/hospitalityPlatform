<p>It kind of started as a joke, but I actually tried it with a client who was having trouble visualizing the apartment she wanted to buy on pre sales. When I started in this business I had tons of trouble myself, imagining spaces and sizes so I could relate to her struggle. I am a very visual person myself. So I came up with: “let´s just draw it in the sand” idea, since the beach is literally one block away from Arco Properties office.</p>
<p>So we went there, armed with a measuring tape and a stick.  We spent maybe ten minutes on it. The results were super fun, I mean, our wall lines could only had been described as “free flowing art” and &#8220;well intentioned&#8221;, but somehow we got the general idea. Now that I think of it, it kind of looked like a Barbapapa house. If you don´t know what I´m talking about, <a href="http://www.playingbythebook.net/2010/03/25/barbapapa/">click HERE. </a></p>
<p>I was feeling so proud. Then a second opportunity came, when friends of ours were having trouble imagining the rooms of another place. I said, “hey, why don´t you draw it at the beach, I just did it the other day and was fun”.   As those internet cliffhanger posts say “we were not prepared for what happened next”.</p>
<p>The photos they sent me were absolutely amazing: a perfectly drawn apartment on the sand: kitchen, bedroom, living room, everything to detail and scale. It could not be any more perfect, not even with real furniture. I couldn´t come out of my shock, I had to know how they did it.  Their response was equally wonderful and simple, all you need is: “1 measuring tape, a stick and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/z3g9q6f/revision">Pythagoras method</a>”.</p>
<p>I guess I was short of one item from that list!</p>

<p>If you are a beer connoseiur, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bierklooster/">´t Bier Klooster</a> is your spot. Located at Casa Neuman, in front of Ocho y Medio, this small hangout has a wide variety of Belgian beer ranging from my favorite wheat beers to the crazy red beers. Mejillones (oysers) were really good, but the potato chips with mayonaisse are the best in town.</p>

<p>Ops! dropped my phone and  broke the screen. How many times we´ve gone through something like this. And then what a pain: while there are several ways to go about it, the awful truth is that most likely we will allow this situation to go on and on until it starts cutting our face or not even being able to use the touchscreen again. And by then we are on a different stress diagnosis.</p>
<p>No need! if you live in Casco, just go Creative Solutions. Located at 3rd street , at Los Del Patio, they can fix your iphone and laptop. They also have games (if you want to wait) and have video surveilance services, sell routers and phone accesories.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Last night, Casco Viejo was full of great activities! free concerts at Plaza Catedral and Plaza V Centenario for completely different reasons: the celebration of Panama´s Red Cross 100 years and the celebration of Great! Britain´s week.  Panama is now sister city with Liverpool, so the event included a movie and music by the Beatles. Amazing cocktails!</p>
<p>The Red Cross event had its own celebrities: the family of Lady Mallet, who founded Red Cross in Panama assisted. There is even a building in Casco called Casa Mallet, as per its original owner.</p>
<p>Finally, we had a blast going to Cine Animal at Temporal, where they were showing the art work of Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker. For the first time, all of their videos were shown together in a retrospective from 2006 to 2014.  They have one called &#8220;Domino Effect&#8221; filmed in Casco, our favorite. But their themes go from the environment to financial and cultural. Go check it out!</p>

<p>I think we all agree fried food has gotten beat up in the last few years. But Entre Pulgas, at <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo in Panama</a> is coming to the rescue&#8230;</p>
<p>Beside Hotel Central, and a few steps away from <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,ea18749b-a287-46ce-8164-2cf467d5c2db.aspx" target="_blank">Grandclement Ice Cream</a>, are opening &#8220;Frit &#8211; Arts&#8221; a restaurant with an &#8220;all fried&#8221; concept plus art gallery.   Not sure what their menu will be, but don´t expect light salads and soups. This promises to be a place of &#8220;sinful pleasures&#8221;. If everything goes well, they should be on soft opening by next week. With<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,39127884-9b82-4159-a207-0dc21bd1673d.aspx" target="_blank"> Music Fest </a>coming on the 20th, they´ve picked the right week</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>&#8220;Fete de la Musique&#8221; or Fiesta de la Musica (Music Fest) For June 20th</p>
<p>This year, the French Embassy will be hosting the event along with the <a href="http://www.cascoantiguo.gob.pa/">Oficina del Casco Antiguo (OCA).</a> From folkloric music to jazz, rock and the fuzzy &#8220;world music&#8221;, Music Fest will have about 35 artists running around <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo,</a> almost literally.</p>
<p>Logistics: As they have done in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,bc88546c-d20e-4783-b363-64240552e162.aspx" target="_blank">other festivals</a>, parking in Casco Antiguo will only be for residents. General parking will be located at the Causeway in Amador, and there will be free transportation to the Casco throughout the festival. Usually, they also open the parking spaces at the San Felipe Neri fruit &amp; vegetable market, right in front of the Fish Market, at the entrance of the Casco.</p>
<p>Who will be playing and where&#8230;.starting at 3 p.m&#8230;..<br />
ps. just in case, bring an umbrella and a folding chair.  In Panama, rainny season tends to be in the afternoon, probably by 3 will be ok, but you never know&#8230;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[What´s the Panamanian thing to do on Sundays? ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Yupi! it´s Sunday!&#8230; or even better&#8230; it is Dim Sum Sunday&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, you heard right. Panamanians jump on their feet when thinking about Chinese food.  Why?  Because our cultures basically grew up together.  I don´t think I´ve seen anywhere else the same proportion of Black-chinese / Criollo-chinese than in Panama.  Some of our most stunning Panamanians are from African Chinese parents.</p>
<p>Recently, they celebrated the 150th anniversary of the chinese colony in Panama, basically 50 years more (aprox) than the republic itself. They are everywhere and in everything, a big motor of the economy. But probably the best part of the relationship between Panamanians and Chinese is Dim Sum. We love Dim Sum (Desayuno Chino). And although the original China Town is located in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama´s Colonial Quarter</a>, the best restaurants for Sunday Dim Sum are outside Casco.  A lot of Panamanians are followers of Lung Fung and but I like Golden Unicorn at the Evergreen Building.</p>
<p>Hummm&#8230;.. it is an affair that takes a couple of hours, so plan on getting up really early (otherwise, you´ll have to do a line&#8230;) 8 a.m. is a good hour for this. It is probably the closest thing Panama has to &#8220;brunch&#8221;. You can linger there until lunchtime, between hampaos, jasmine tea and beer.  Somehow it all mixes well, don´t ask.</p>
<p>And then&#8230; straight to siesta! no way you´ll move the rest of the day. Unless you have coffee and cake at another Panamanian icon: Las Hadas. Hotels come and go, but Las Hadas remain. Once you are done with your Chinese breakfast, roll yourself to the Ceasar Park/ Sheraton/ I´m not sure what it is called now (alias, the hotel next to</p>

<p>the ATLAPA Convention Center). Don´t look at the casino, just keep walking. Past the reception, go to the end of the hall where the shops are. Shinning bright at the end of the hall you´ll find a cute place with wonderful sweets.</p>
<p>If you have space, coffee is very good and sweets and great. After that, you´ll better book a room and sleep right where you are&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Under the &#8220;Only in Panama&#8221; category&#8230;.</p>
<p>Low tide is a blessing in <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx">Casco Viejo</a>. Suddenly, pockets of beaches pop up, and access to others open. Yesterday (or was it the day before?) I was walking my little (or not so little!) Chispa around and realized it was low &#8211; low tide. So we went down the beach at Calle 1era, in front of the parking spaces next to the <a title="National Theatre Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/teatronacional.aspx" target="_blank">National Theatre</a>, and kept walking under the <a title="San Francisco de Asis Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/sanfranciscodeasis.aspx" target="_blank">San Francisco de Asis Church</a> towards the current Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Then I continued to walk, and another beach was there, the one behind the Presidential Palace. They all connect going down to Terraplen! boy, I´m looking forward for the cleaning of the bay to be complete (another 5 years!)&#8230; it was nice down there.</p>
<p>Only a presidential policeman who sort of tried to tell me that I couldn´t pass. But since I was in my &#8220;teacher&#8221; mood (I usually am when walking Chispa, you know like &#8220;no, don´t do this&#8230; yes, good girl&#8230;giving instructions) I told him that the beach by the Panamanian Constitution is public and that the President is free to put all the guards he wants, but can´t declare any beach private.  So, actually, I am free to go there with my bikini and tan under the <a title="Presidential Palace Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/presidencia.aspx" target="_blank">Presidential Palace</a>.  He smiled and let me be with my dog around&#8230;</p>

<p>Tuesday night after Panama´s Presidential election: bars are open, business back to normal.  We had such a mellow time under the stars at <a title="Plaza Bolivar Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/sanfranciscodeasis.aspx" target="_blank">Plaza Bolivar</a>. Had great gnocci and some vodka pesto pasta at <a title="business in Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,ea18749b-a287-46ce-8164-2cf467d5c2db.aspx" target="_blank">Narciso</a>. Some of our Australian friends who just came back from a surf weekend at Bocas del Toro where at the table next to us.  Jorge, the owner came out to say hi and chat about the latest neighborhood news. Some French bohemian musicians passed by with their flutes and played for a couple of minutes. White and red wine&#8230; and ready to go back home!  As we strolled back, we played with our dog in one of the small parks.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Presidential Elections are now very boring compared to the Noriega times. In a true "show off" of democracy, a businessman was elected President of Panama. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>In many countries, Presidential elections tend to be crazy. Here, it is the most boring day of the year (well&#8230; ever since we got our democracy back in 1989).  The fun part is the days before it.  This year, it fell coincidentally on a long weekend, as May 1st was Friday&#8230; but because of the elections, sales and consumption of alcohol was going to be restricted for both Saturday and Sunday. So every street in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> had something going on Friday.</p>
<p>It was also the first true winter weekend, a lot of rain poured, so thousands and thousands of bugs, crazy size ants (queens and males finally coming out of the ground to mate and die the next morning) made their annual appearance, announcing the change of the season. Birds went nuts feeding on them, we even saw a big hawk standing at one of the balconies choosing its next meal, Casco Viejo &#8220;other neighbors&#8221; where feeling the call of nature. It was fascinating, like being in a jungle!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Casco%20Antiguo%20Bugs.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="239" height="179" /> <img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Casco%20Viejo%20Bug.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="308" height="231" /> <img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Casco%20Antiguo%20Hawk.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="190" height="254" /></p>
<p>Well, not too far away, political party flags where hung on balconies, people woke up really early on Sunday dressed either with their best dresses or with political TShirts.  I thought this also ressembled nature´s dance, as often birds and other animals change color to attract their mates. Like bees, everone went to the schools to vote. Unlike other countries, everyone in Panama votes.  Election day is always a Sunday, and the political parties usually help with transportation.  Especially in the interior of the country, transportation is arranged. On election sunday, every bus, taxi, canue and mule is hired to get people to vote. This year, they made it possible for Panamanians abroad to vote and also for people in jail.   Last elections 76% of Panamanians with right to vote, voted.  Not sure what the number is for this year, but probably will be more.</p>
<p>The process is so easy and fluent, people tend to be really nice and take their task seriously. I was glad to see so many people from the neighborhood taking their role with total devotion.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Panama%20Elections.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="303" height="247" /> <img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Casco%20Viejo%20Elections.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="326" height="246" /></p>
<p>Our elections are not done electronically.  Privacy during the elections is considered sacred, and our only weapon in times of need. We won´t even use electronic devices for our Lottery.  That too falls into the sacred category, by the way.  Usually they give you four papers in order to vote for each category, and they are counted manually.  The judges, with witnesses from every party, count at the end and they write down the results in an Acta. Then, in front of everyone, they burn the papers at the school patios. So there is no re count possibilites.  &#8220;Back in the days&#8221; (meaning in the Noriega times and even before) here was where the action happened. The votes where &#8220;stolen&#8221; &#8230;. literally. In order to protect the votes, the boxes with the papers inside where carried outside the school into people´s homes to protect it, as it was a normal cheating strategy to count &#8220;incorrectly&#8221; and put whatever number at the Acta.  Even though times have changed, the seriousness in the faces of those who have the responsibility of guarding our votes tell me there must be a memory of those times somewhere ingrained in their brains.</p>
<p>In Panama, you only have a chance to vote until 4 p.m.  Results are known around 6 p.m. but they confirm it no later than 7 p.m. Definately you know who won before 8 p.m.</p>
<p>This year, and for the first time after the invasion, a candidate won for over 50%.  Ricardo Martinelly won with a very big 60% product of his tenacity (he has run in two different campaigns now), his marketing (his slogan &#8220;Los Locos somos Más&#8221; was a bit unorthodox, but catchy) and the political alliance he was able to put together with the other oposition parties. But I feel most people, after the scandals of corruption and missmanagement of the current government, just aligned themselves against it, and Martinelli was the candidate that had the most chance of winning. Therefore, Balbina Herrera, the candidate for the government party (PRD) lost with a 37%.</p>
<p>So, what should be expected from Martinelli? If anything, Martinelli´s campaign has shown a creative team, capable of thinking outside the box and being able to work with competitors for a goal. If Ricardo Martinelli keeps these qualities during his government, then we should be on a good track. Buy only time will tell.</p>

<p>1. You can walk everywhere.  And if you are entrepreneurial, you can even set up your business here and forget about the car almost all week round.<br />
2. Plenty of choices on <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,ea18749b-a287-46ce-8164-2cf467d5c2db.aspx" target="_blank">restaurants</a>, more coming on bars (all at walking distance)<br />
3. When walking around, most likely you´ll end up saying Hi to at least five people in the street.<br />
4. You can volunteer in different areas, from urban agriculture to art workshops for local children.<br />
5. <a href="http://www.cascoantiguo.gob.pa/" target="_blank">Free concerts and cultural activities </a>in general everywhere, from Jazz Fest to <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,bc88546c-d20e-4783-b363-64240552e162.aspx" target="_blank">balcony theatre </a>at Plaza Herrera<br />
6. The <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,f40ade3f-ce84-4f69-b841-a3825379ceb6.aspx" target="_blank">beach</a> and surrounding water views: it is a great place to walk around. Someday soon it will be clean enough to get in there, although most locals already do!<br />
7. People are nice to each other, especially the &#8220;bien cuidaos&#8221;<br />
8. Music in every corner. Sometimes too loud! but I know now that when it isn´t there I miss it (or immediately think there is something wrong in the picture)<br />
9. Avenida Central and Salsipuedes at a few steps away. To walk around Salsipuedes, find really weird stuff no one has anymore and bargain.<br />
10. The art of strolling around hand in hand with your loved one. Nothing like sharing a $0.50 raspao at Las Bovedas (lots of sugar!) while enjoying the beautiful sunset.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Health care in Panama can be 50% cheaper than in the States. Most doctors have trainned in the States and even practice surgery there on regular basis. With medicare dropping coverage, Panama´s health tourism seems to be on the rise. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Health insurance and general health care seems to be one of the most stressful issues in the United States today. With hundreds of thousands of workers laid off last year, and health problems on the rise &#8211; many of them without coverage, people are looking outside for options.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.martesfinanciero.com/article.asp?id=228&amp;seccion=4&amp;edition=21" target="_blank">Martes Financiero</a> at La Prensa last Tuesday published a comparison chart of what <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a> has to offer. For example, Bypass in the States can cost up to $133,000 dollars. Replacing a knee might be $53,000 and even cosmetic intervention can be up to $16,000.  Health insurance, even with international cover (and depending on your health situation) might be as low as $70 per month.</p>
<p>But what about quality? While public health care is a national disaster, private health is competitive at an international level. A wide number of doctors that attend privately have studied in the States, some even exercise there (especially surgeons), operating regularly at hospitals in Houston.   US hospitals like John Hopkins have now a branch in Panama.  However,  a bypass hin Panama costs $10,500, a knee replacement is $5,500 and facial surgery is $2,500.</p>
<p>It seems that Panama is almost 50% cheaper than the States and quality isn´t compromised.  Dental work seems to be also popular.  According to the article, there are companies like Medical Tourism Panama and Pana- health are dedicated to provide services to the foreign patient, from travel arrangements to accomodation, transportation, and of course, hospital services.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Obama is lifting finally parts of the Cuban embargo. While you are thinking on traveling to Cuba, read this first&#8230;.</p>
<p>Since colonial days <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,2f3840ab-106b-4684-9824-88571e5f3957.aspx" target="_blank">Panama </a>and Cuba have had strong bonds and almost similar development. They where both the &#8220;trade&#8221; places of excellence during the Spanish Gold (and slave) trade, which attracted people from all around the known world to make business. If you look at both historic cities, Havana and <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a> (also known as Casco Viejo) they are the only two &#8220;colonial&#8221; cities in the region that display a wide range of architectural styles. Everyone else is pure Spanish Colonial (Cartagena, San Juan, Antigua, just to mention a couple). This was not pure luck, it was the reflection of the people who lived in them.</p>
<p>Panama´s Casco Antiguo is a vibrant and more accesible mini jewel version of big Havana: colonial buildings sit wall to wall with Caribbean wooden houses, with Art Deco buildings, Republican buildings from the time of the Panama Canal and even fusion: there are several buildings that are French- Caribbean and so on. For the last ten years, the old Casco Viejo has been undergoing a revitalization</p>
<div class="photo_style_inline_left" style="width:304px;"><a class="ptl" href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/3693451.html"><img style="border:medium none;" title="The Cuban - Panama culture" src="http://img7.travelblog.org/Photos/56385/390576/t/3693451-The-Cuban--Panama-culture-0.jpg" alt="The Cuban - Panama culture" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<a class="ptl" href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/3693451.html"><strong>The Cuban &#8211; Panama culture</strong></a><br />
Music. This is a picture of Casa de la Musica in Havana.</div>
<p>process, which allows you to <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,9fedce28-5f3b-4155-a7f2-6c308ba03125.aspx" target="_blank">own a piece of history</a> in the form of a charming <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/howto.aspx" target="_blank">restored condo</a> or a <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/Search.aspx?min=0&amp;type=Renovated%20Commercial&amp;list=sale&amp;order=price" target="_blank">commercial space</a>. Casco Antiguo is business friendly place, welcoming all entrepreneurs to open bars, hotels, restaurants and much more. And is only a few minutes away from a cosmopolitan city and from primary forest.</p>
<p>Cuba and Panama are both defined by the word crossroads. This has shaped both cultures the same way: deeply Caribbean. Dance, food, speech, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,71f3900e-812c-4ec1-b9ba-74f7fcf768dc.aspx" target="_blank">superstitions.</a> Panama´s geography turned it into a<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,556e5eac-cae3-4a66-a3f4-e444977f9206.aspx" target="_blank"> business hub</a>, more likely to be described as Costa Rica meets Hong Kong. With a <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,c49975ed-c42c-46e9-8e88-29a1685ee51a.aspx" target="_blank">conservative banking </a>system, a Canal and diversified economy, it lead the region for the last couple of years growing at incredible rates comparable only to China. Even in this market, it will continue to<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,24c469a9-38ac-4d96-bcf3-74391c6c940a.aspx" target="_blank"> grow over 3%, </a>leading the region. Democracy is steady, a dollarized economy.</p>
<p>Watching photographs of people from Cuba and from Panama you´ll get a sense that you are looking at the same DNA pool. And probably you are! Panamanian and Cuban relations grew stronger &#8211; strange enough &#8211; during our military regimes. Both Omar Torrijos and Fidel Castro where great friends, and Cuban troops</p>
<div class="photo_style_inline" style="width:304px;"><a class="ptl" href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/3693454.html"><img style="border:medium none;" title="Old Havana" src="http://img7.travelblog.org/Photos/56385/390576/t/3693454-Old-Havana-0.jpg" alt="Old Havana" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />

Colonial city of Havana.  Only Casco Viejo and Havana have this mix.</div>
<p>would visit Panama to train in our jungles. Roberto Duran, Panama´s most famous boxing glory visited Castro flying in Torrijo´s private plane and was welcomed and invited to dinner with Castro himself.</p>
<p>One of the main differences in our cultures, though, is product of a simple fact: Panama´s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Panama" target="_blank">history</a> never had any violence in its upbringing. None of our independences or separations where product of a big or long revolutions where thousands of lives where lost in a conflict that lasted several years. This seems to be the case of every Latin American and Caribbean country. When thinking about it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Haiti" target="_blank">Haiti´s</a> case comes to mind. While the first country to declare independece from its colonial state, it has sunk into the deepest of poverties because of its prolonged state of civil war. Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and many islands of the Caribbean followed the same path&#8230; with the same unfortunate results. Cuba had its Cuban revolution and a prolonged period of being on &#8220;survival mode&#8221; because of the US Embargo which Obama is finally lifting slowly. But Panama had none of that. Therefore, our people are non violent, non confrontational. While we might be loud as any Caribbean guy would be, aggression just isn´t part of our culture.</p>

<a class="ptl" href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/3693456.html"><strong>Playful Style</strong></a><br />
Buses in Panama and in Cuba show the playful culture of the Caribbean</div>
<p>We are the &#8220;happy go lucky&#8221; of Latin America, and is a lucky country indeed as everything Latin America has, Panama has it as well&#8230; just in a &#8220;boutique&#8221; portion. From <a href="http://www.stri.org/english/visit_us/index.php" target="_blank">rain forest to cloud forest</a>, from abandoned crystal clear beach (and rocky tan beaches too) to a caotic modern Panama City with restaurants offering great cuisine, from a 300 year old colonial quarter to a rustic town in the country side where homes are still made of clay with a technique that gathers the entire town in a celebration in order to build it, Panama is where everything can be experienced one bit at a time in less than 5 days. From here, you can take a direct flight to Havana and transport yourself to the past. Dance at Casa de la Musica (please, do not visit Tropicana, is not worth it), eat at any Paladar or walk the Malecon. And between the two you´ll get the most complete understanding of what the best of Latin Culture has to offer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Check out the latest United Nation´s report regarding Latin America´s growth for 2009]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><figure id="attachment_807" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-807" title="crecimientoal2009_cp010409" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/crecimientoal2009_cp010409.jpg" alt="Panama´s Growth according to United Nations" width="1024" height="767" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/crecimientoal2009_cp010409.jpg 1995w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/crecimientoal2009_cp010409-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/crecimientoal2009_cp010409-1024x767.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Panama´s Growth according to United Nations</figcaption></figure>
<p>United Nation´s economic agency for Latin America and the Caribbean called<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=0b4066f1-b2c6-47d4-9bf9-ae3b7cd7d3f6&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eclac.org%2f"> CEPAL </a>(Comision Economica para America Latina y el Caribe / Economic Comission for Latin America and the Caribbean) published in its website their growth <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=0b4066f1-b2c6-47d4-9bf9-ae3b7cd7d3f6&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eclac.org%2fprensa%2fnoticias%2fcomunicados%2f7%2f35627%2fcrecimientoAL2009_CP010409.pdf">projections for the region for 2009</a>.  According to their economic study, Panama will grow over 3% this year, leading the region´s development and surviving the crisis better than its peers (at least for 2009).</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>, things are moving along on all fronts. Several new businesses have opened, this time mostly locals: two new stores and a beauty salon, all of them in San Felipe. Doña Daisy, formerly on Calle 1era is now at the Santa Familia complex in Avenida A and Calle 5ta, a few steps away from the <a href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/" target="_blank">Canal House Hotel</a>.  At Las Bovedas in Plaza Francia, a small handcraft store opened for tourist: it offers coffee, drinks and hand painted crafts, mostly fans (under this hot summer you come to appreciate!). The beauty salon is called Virginia, and is at the very entrance of San Felipe: you´ll see it to your left as you go up the bridge.  Friendly owners and nice creative nails. Washed and blower my long hair for $8.</p>
<p>Seeing these guys go forward with their businesses makes me think about that 3%.  A cold number for many, but very significant when you dig in and you get to see the faces of who make it possible. This is what gives you hope, for although times are and can be tough, there is nothing as surrounding yourself with positive energy.</p>

<p>Slowly, organically, through patience and passion, <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>has grown to be Panama´s point of reference not only to experience the roots of the country but for most art events, concerts and shows. Artists roam the streets looking for gallery space or for a studio, even if in an unrestored building. Casco´s special social fabric where the poorest and the richest live side by side, getting along well and collaborating to make this a better neighborhood has also a lot to do with it. Also, the government´s help through the Oficina del Casco Antiguo, the Municipality, and the Historic Patrimony offices have been fantastic.</p>
<p>For Example: just last week <a title="Casa Gongora" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,12360602-3e4f-4bbb-81d3-8b33b71e2059.aspx" target="_blank">Casa Góngora</a> (which has become a regular spot for concerts Wednesdays and Fridays and an art gallery for emerging artist all other days) was showing pieces of sculpture Xenia Judith called &#8220;Esencia y Figuras&#8221; (Escence and Shapes). The same week, the <a href="http://www.cascoantiguo.gob.pa/" target="_blank">Oficina del Casco Antiguo</a> inaugurated another low income housing that will provide locals that are currently living in condemned buildings that need to get restored with beautiful housing, so they can continue to live in their own neighborhoods. Right in front of Casa Francia (this is the name of the new restored project, next to the iconic <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/boyaca.aspx" target="_blank">Boyacá</a> at Plaza Herrera) you have the Danilo Perez Foundation, which is a music and jazz school for local kids. These locals at the same time are the source of inspiration <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,dee9c37a-87e5-48f7-bc42-43c48d70d880.aspx" target="_blank">and &#8220;salsa&#8221; of the hood</a>. A perfect circle closes and feeds each stage to a renewed cycle.</p>
<p>I have to say they did a wonderful job rehabilitating the old Casa Francia. Plaza Herrera is becoming slowly one of the most interesting plazas in the neighborhood. Almost four fully restored social buildings housing locals that are actively contributing to the neighborhood with their businesses (from food, to seemstres, to haircuts, shoe repair shop and more). Other projects have started construction nearby, expanding this <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/casarosada.aspx" target="_blank">wave of rescue</a> of the Caribbean patrimony of Casco Antiguo. But it doesn´t stop there, as Plaza Herrera is also home to the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,828a4948-30fc-4f84-901c-b6fb011b5f02.aspx" target="_blank">Danilo Pérez Foundation</a>, a recently created jazz school at the old Music Conservatory building, right in front of Boyacá.</p>
<p>International music star, Danilo Pérez, and local developer Conservatorio S.A. entered in an agreement where the developer donated space to the foundation in this beautiful building for ten years. Children from the area are already attending to classes, some under scholarships and some incredibly talented ones had even gotten fellowships to study at the New England Conservatory.</p>
<p>Not bad for a 300 year old colonial city, only 15 streets and 3 avenues!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">With a diversified economy and a strong, conservative, banking system, Panama is on the move to protect the country as much as possible from the current economic crisis.<span> </span>For the last three years, Panama positioned itself as one of the fastest growing economies in the region, with numbers as far as 10% a growth reached only by countries such as China. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Worldwide, this year has been very different for everyone. But Panama’s advantage over the region may survive based on its diversified economy and mega projects that are being fueled by the government to support the system while times get tougher. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the big scheme, as reporter Yolanda Sandoval from La Prensa notes in her last article “<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=24c469a9-38ac-4d96-bcf3-74391c6c940a&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.martesfinanciero.com%2farticle.asp%3fid%3d216%26seccion%3d5%26edition%3d20">Liquid Transfusion: in the hands of Multilateral Agencies”</a>, last December,<span> </span>the ACP (Canal Authority of Panama) signed credit with five multilateral agencies for over two thousand million dollars to finance the Panama Canal Expansion. 2,300 million Dollars only with the <a title="BID" href="http://www.iadb.org/NEWS/detail.cfm?lang=es&amp;id=4934" target="_blank">Inter-American Development Bank</a>. This mega project is already gaining momentum, and is expected to employ most of the construction workers that may be laid off from the real estate industry.</span><!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;  Normal 0 21   false false false        MicrosoftInternetExplorer4  &lt;![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;   &lt;![endif]--><!--[if !mso]&gt;--></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> From our experience, even in real estate, niches such as Panama’s colonial town <a title="Casco  Veijo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> (a UNESCO protected World Heritage site also known as Casco Antiguo) are <a title="Market Casco Veijo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/SearchView.aspx?q=market%20update" target="_blank">still thriving.</a> <a title="Hotels Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,ea18749b-a287-46ce-8164-2cf467d5c2db.aspx" target="_blank">Hotels</a> are being built; projects are being completed and delivered. Every commercial space seems rented and there is demand for more. Investors are attracted by the limited supply of unique real estate and the influx of tourism, as one of Panama’s most visited sites. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Panamanian banks are also being proactive. The Inter-American Development Bank has approved a loan for <a title="Growth Program" href="http://www.iadb.org/news/detail.cfm?language=English&amp;id=4806" target="_blank">500 million dollars</a> to finance a program called <a title="BID" href="http://www.soitu.es/soitu/2008/11/17/info/1226897873_347834.html" target="_blank">Liquidity Program for Sustained Growth</a>. This financing will be part of a stimulus package that the Panamanian Government has announced as a first front to counter the effects of the crisis.<span> </span>The Government package includes 1,110 million dollars to incentive credit to investments. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Private Banks have also gone out to lobby funding. <a title="Global Bank Panama" href="http://www.globalbank.com.pa/" target="_blank">Global Bank </a>got a credit line through the Inter- American Development Bank and IFC. About 25 million dollars will be earmarked for micro and middle size companies.<span> </span><a title="Banco General Panama" href="http://www.bgeneral.com/bgespanol/personal/index.htm" target="_blank">Banco General,</a> one of Panama’s leading banks, received financing from the </span><span lang="EN-US">Inter- American Development Bank</span><span lang="EN-US"> for 80 million dollars to support the growth of their long term clients, especially mortgages. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The article also points out that as competition for money gets harder, the region will be competing with Asia, Europe, and the United States; international financial institutions will consider seriously how governments have preserved their social policies.<span> </span>Being actively involved in commercial exchange will be a big positive point.<span> </span>Because of its geographic location and facilities, several international agencies are already setting headquarters in Panama which will benefit the country when applying for funds. The General Secretary of Iberoamerica (<a href="http://www.segib.org/" target="_blank">Secretaria General de Iberoamerica</a>) inaugurated their branch and next May the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm" target="_blank">International Monetary Fund </a>will have a new Regional Center for Technical Assistance to Central America, Panama and Dominican Republic. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The biggest threats for the region are unemployment and deceleration. But as Enrique Iglesias current Secretary General for Iberoamerica said in his interview to La Prensa, “the fundamental piece is the recovery of banks”. At least here, Panama seems to be an easier case.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-785" title="panama-cinta-costera" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/panama-cinta-costera.jpg" alt="panama-cinta-costera" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/panama-cinta-costera.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/panama-cinta-costera-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />With Presidential elections coming up in May, Panama´s current government seems to have given green light to speed things up. Major projects like the expansion of the Panama Canal and the Cinta Costera seem to be moving faster each day. The Cinta Costera,  even if not fully finished, has already started to wear it´s green clothes: palms, bushes and trees are already planted, ready to inaugurate.</p>
<p>For <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, Panama City´s colonial quarter and end tip of the Cinta Costera, it is all good news. On this side of the cinta, the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=94700a4a-a2af-4575-a6f5-a7f1c427ec90&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.arcoproperties.com%2fblogs%2fmain%2fPermaLink%2cguid%2c4add71a2-994d-44b8-9a79-66bb692dc2e7.aspx">new pipes for the sewer treatment are being placed.</a> Soon, the Cinta Costera´s park will touch Casco Antiguo nearby the Mercado del Marisco (Fish Market) allowing direct access to a fantastic outdoors area.</p>
<p>For Casco Antiguo residentes, this will be an added plus to their lifestyles. Already living in a 300 year old colonial city with the human scale of a small town but embedded 10 minutes away from modern Panama, residents of Casco Viejo have only to walk two minutes <a title="Beach Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,f40ade3f-ce84-4f69-b841-a3825379ceb6.aspx" target="_blank">to get to a beach</a>. As the Bay cleanning project advances, they´ll be  the first ones to benefit from it´s surf spot at the point of Las Bovedas.  Already a popular surf point for locals, as the current female surf champion <a title="Surf Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,a281b6a5-93e8-436f-a99b-fee30ff07c4c.aspx" target="_blank">Samantha</a> lives in San Felipe and surfs there regularly.</p>
<p>With the Cinta Costera, they will now have a fantastic strech of park for outdoors activities,  everything within ten minutes walking.</p>
<p>As traffic and cost of living raises, Casco Viejo is probably one of the few places in Panama that offers bits of city and town living at the same time, no car necessary, unless you want to explore the jungle or to travel to the country side.  This is making it attractive to a younger profile who is not finding any exciting options at their home countries. The United States alone, announced over an 8% unemployment rate.  <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,a4490ef5-8360-4f88-915e-f376fd70559d.aspx" target="_blank">Moving oversees </a>to start a new business or just to keep a low profile seems to be getting more popular along <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,a0d12f92-af4a-4ef9-95af-ddcab1baa6d7.aspx" target="_blank">young professionals</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Casco Antiguo is growing as Panama City´s art center. But not only from the outside... but from the inside. A new program now teaches dance for free to local children, with one of the best modern dance troupes in the region. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><figure id="attachment_778" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-778" title="casco-viejo-events" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/casco-viejo-events.jpg" alt="Colegio del Cuerpo in Casco Viejo, Panama" width="671" height="503" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/casco-viejo-events.jpg 800w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/casco-viejo-events-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Colegio del Cuerpo in Casco Viejo, Panama</figcaption></figure>
<p>To spark change through dance. To transform children forever, from inside out. Any casual observer would see a beautiful modern dance troupe that could have easily been from New York. But it wasn´t just &#8220;any troupe&#8221;. It was Colegio del Cuerpo.<br />
<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=73f521c9-e167-4277-bd29-7a9403105509&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elcolegiodelcuerpo.org%2f">Colegio del Cuerpo</a> is a dance troupe from Cartagena that was born in the poorest area of Colombia´s historic town. It was founded by Alvaro Restrepo, taking children from the streets and opening the doors of art to them. Ten years later, the company is worldclass. Interesting, well trainned, produces beautiful and meaningful ballets. After their presentation in Panama last year at the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=73f521c9-e167-4277-bd29-7a9403105509&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.arcoproperties.com%2fblogs%2fmain%2fPermaLink%2cguid%2cd2429ff9-b2c9-4e8f-9ea1-ebd6a25c7b43.aspx">Sobresaltos Dance Festival in Casco Viejo</a>, the Oficina del Casco Antiguo worked with them to set up a similar program in Panama´s historic city. It was a dream for the fifteen kids who originally participated in Sobresaltos.</p>
<p>But also a vital element for those involved in the revitalization of Casco Antiguo. Currently Panama City´s second tourism destination, the historic area is thriving. Hotels are being built, restaurants and bars are very often busy, and <a title="Casco Viejo Events" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/SearchView.aspx?q=dance" target="_blank">art festivals or miscellaneous events</a> are now part of the colonial city´s fabric.  Locals are an important part of this development, and art is one of the best ways they can express themselves and collaborate with the best of their culture.</p>
<p>Last week, the official inauguration of the program took place at Plaza Bolívar, at the current Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Colegio del Cuerpo did a great show in front of a large number of kids, now all future dancers.  To see Alvaro Restrepo say at the end: &#8220;my dancers where your age when they started&#8221; and to see the results right there, was simply incredible.</p>

<p>This weekend at <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx">Casco Viejo </a>was a lot of fun. It rained a lot, as October tends to be the rainniest month in the year. However, we had a lot of fun!  Platea started early, as usual, with <a title="Jazz Fest Panama 2008" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,32c6053b-2589-4b6c-9d53-c3620bd628b9.aspx" target="_blank">jazz</a> night on Thursday and salsa on Friday. But La Casona had also a nice couple of events and our favorite &#8220;heavy metal &#8211; rock&#8221; bar called <a title="Baños Publicos" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,cb3bfb10-d672-4865-b80f-aba79c8bda26.aspx" target="_blank">Baños Públicos (Public Bathrooms) </a>was at its best with Beto playing anything from Hotel California and Canto Boliviano to Samba. Wao!</p>
<p>Here are some shots from La Casona. I was so happy to finally take some pictures from inside. The wonderful high ceilings of the art deco building they are at now makes such a  great spot for alternative theatre or movie&#8230; but it is hard to photograph! We where there to see the theatre play Karaoke Sentimental, a play by Teatro Lagartija. They also had the art show <a title="La Casona" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,f563ee3c-0116-46b1-b1b9-45e5b043af5d.aspx" target="_blank">7 Pinceles</a>, with fun paintings by Rolando de Sedas, Marta Noemi and Marta Sanchez, among others.</p>

<p>Last night, a group of friends organized a tapas night at <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=1ba6f0c2-9c12-42ca-b9b0-0c10ca26d2ea&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.canalhousepanama.com%2f">Canal House</a> in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> with Argimiro, a Panamanian young chef who studied in Spain and even did his professional practice at the famous El Bulli Restaurant (Ferrán Adriá, 2 and 3 Michelin stars!).  When Argimiro returned to Panama, he fell in love with <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> and I have to say we fell in love with his food, so anytime he organizes a party or just a tapas night we are more than thrilled. And last night was really great.</p>
<p>The thing with tapas is that you think they are so small you are not really eating that much&#8230; but wao! we had so much interesting stuff, reinterpretacions of Panamanian cuisine (like our carimañolas but with other ingredients), all the way to duck (but made into cigar shapes and fresh &amp; spicy orange sauce as a side dish). My favorite was a corvina fish with two types of sauces but made in different textures, so one floated on top of the other, one spicier than the other. Some sort of mouse and the other was more of a sauce. My friend loved the shrimp, tasted almost grilled but it was zafron. And the dessert  (I fall for the sweets!) was another reinterpretation that involved strawberries and some sort of cream I´m still trying to define, decorated with edible flowers.</p>
<p>I can´t wait for him to open his restaurant! it is expected to open in December, right on <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=1ba6f0c2-9c12-42ca-b9b0-0c10ca26d2ea&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.arcoproperties.com%2fplazaamador.aspx">Plaza Catedral</a>. He´ll work with local ingredients from our <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=1ba6f0c2-9c12-42ca-b9b0-0c10ca26d2ea&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.arcoproperties.com%2fblogs%2fmain%2fPermaLink%2cguid%2c10e19f7a-bc97-4c33-b0c1-60694716a4dc.aspx">urban agriculture program</a>, so it promises to be an experience! healthy and sustainable. I have some really weird stuff growing on my balcony, like these neon yellow eggplants and starfruit. I wonder what he can do with those!</p>

Last night, a group of friends organized a tapas night at <a href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/">Canal<br />
House</a> in Casco Viejo with Argimiro, a Panamanian young chef who studied in Spain<br />
and even did his professional practice at the famous El Bulli Restaurant (Ferrán Adriá,<br />
2 and 3 Michelin stars!).&nbsp; When Argimiro returned to Panama, he fell in love<br />
with Casco Viejo and I have to say we fell in love with his food, so anytime he organizes<br />
a party or just a tapas night we are more than thrilled. And last night was really<br />
great.</p>
<p>The thing with tapas is that you think they are so small you are not really eating<br />
that much&#8230; but wao! we had so much interesting stuff, reinterpretacions of Panamanian<br />
cuisine (like our carimañolas but with other ingredients), all the way to duck (but<br />
made into cigar shapes and fresh &amp; spicy orange sauce as a side dish). My favorite<br />
was a corvina fish with two types of sauces but made in different textures, so one<br />
floated on top of the other, one spicier than the other. Some sort of mouse and the<br />
other was more of a sauce. My friend loved the shrimp, tasted almost grilled but it<br />
was zafron. And the dessert&nbsp; (I fall for the sweets!) was another reinterpretation<br />
that involved strawberries and some sort of cream I´m still trying to define, decorated<br />
with edible flowers.</p>
<p>I can´t wait for him to open his restaurant! it is expected to open in December, right<br />

They forward to us an interesting post from Keys Life newspaper from USA; with a lovely review.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“The Canal House is a shinning example of the revived <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com" target="_blank">San Felipe</a>, as the Casco is properly known. Smack in the middle of that small peninsula, the hotel is a short drive from the Bridge of the Americas and Amador, the gateway to the Panama Canal.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“The next morning, just after breakfast, a religious procession parades past our balcony window. Masses of school kids, clergy and uniformed people, and wooden statue of holy man, ramble down the cobblestones. This was enough to get us out, exploring what felt like an older version of the New Orleans French Quarter, Barcelona’s Gothic Section, or maybe the present back alleys and side-streets of Havana.”</span></p>

If that is your case, read this first. Not only Panama has the best credentials to weather the crisis, but Casco Antiguo within Panama is your winning bet. Do it now, as hotels are starting construction already. Appreciation is on its way. ]]></description>

<p>Investing in Real Estate in Panama. I often comment to my clients that Casco Antiguo is like Woody Allen: either you hate it or you love it, there is no &#8220;in between&#8221;. For the right person (and here are <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,d1f738cc-b968-4ea9-9ea2-adc52a70cacc.aspx" target="_blank">5 steps</a> to know if that is you)  it is very easy to fall in love with it on their first visit. For those who have been following the markets at historic cities, Casco Viejo is a no- brainer: historic, diverse, <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,69a87252-8215-4762-a146-2bd823cd68e1.aspx" target="_blank">full of activity</a>, in a country that is a<a title="Panama Real Estate" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,558b6d43-b878-4d98-8dba-0fc8e9bf6ceb.aspx" target="_blank"> hub to the region</a> in transportation, communication and soon even might be on energy supply.  Ten minutes away from the modern Panama and ten from the ex Canal Zone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">This is the one concrete type of investment that is safer as it gathers several fundamentals: uniqueness, beauty, vibrancy, content, potential. If this is your first time looking at Casco Antiguo real estate, please start by reading <a title="Real Estate Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,3eade9f3-a2f4-443f-9e84-34d45c0e3036.aspx" target="_blank">these few tips.</a> They are very useful in organizing your thoughts, especially if you are planning to travel soon to Panama. If you are already familiar with the Casco Antiguo market, keep reading!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Construction is an intense business, especially in <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>. Yesterday, analizing with a client his options for owning a historic property in Casco Viejo, we went through the numbers of restoring vs buying an already restored condo and there wasn´t even a question about where the good deal was: shift the risk to a professional developer, and not only you´ll get a finished product way cheaper than building it yourself but far less headache and more appreciation/ flexibility.</span></p>
<p>Here is a list of what´s out there currently on pre construction or under construction:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[High season has officially arrived: breeze days, more sun than rain and cruise ship passengers walking around Casco Antiguo. But if you are not into "window shopping" Panama by bus and would like a more local (and budget) trip, here are some interesting options!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo<br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>
<p><br />
Last week we saw the first groups from cruise ships arriving to Casco Viejo. Although it is not my cup of tea, I have to admit they play an important roll on providing business to the local guides (see in the picture, those are guys from Casco) and help them make a living. But with the economic market crisis bouncing up and down, I said to myself, there are so many things to do that doesn´t cost you much and gives you a far better experience than just jumping on a bus and &#8220;window shop&#8221; Panama&#8230;.</p>
<p>Of course, the more money you have, the more options. But if you are not into deep pockets right now and enjoy exploring by land, there are nice options you can get to. For example, this past weekend we went to a far and away town inside Capira bordering the Gatun Lake. The town is called La Arenosa and it is an hour and a half from <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> by car, and you get to the true rural Panama. People in this town are mainly fishermen and carpenters. The place is beautiful and peaceful, filled with cows, hens crossing the road and pineapple farms. There is a great restaurant near the Nautico, 100% local, where you can get very nice fried fish just pulled out from the lake (mostly Tilapia or Sargento fish) with patacones and freezing cold beer. We were 4 people and spent $18 on our meal. But it is not only the fact that is really budget, what we enjoyed the most was the friendly people and the sudden and complete &#8220;stop&#8221; of civilization and rush hour.</p>
<p>Because Casco Antiguo is so close to the Bridge of the Americas and the Centenario bridge, it is your perfect headquarter for your day trips. Take a car and run around these towns, you´ll find interesting surprises. If you want beach, take the ferry and go to Taboga at the Pearl Islands. It is only an hour trip from the port at the Causeway and the local pescao frito there is very good too. You can climb the natural bird reserve or just hang out at the beach. Take the boat in the morning, come back at 3 p.m.  Plan for your next day relaxing in one of the<a title="Casco Antiguo Plazas" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-casco.aspx" target="_blank"> plazas </a>in Casco Antiguo or have a simply stunning meal at the <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,ee3af74c-1cc9-48d4-9178-550403547049.aspx" target="_blank">Fish market</a>.</p>
<p>If you are into nature and hiking, you should get in touch with some of the groups that organize small groups to visit some less known places. There are a couple of organizations that are doing it just for fun and are getting to be more regular. They tend to go out Sunday mornings, really early. From river rafting in the Chagres river (this is the best time, as it is rainning a lot) to expeditions to the caves of Lake Alajuela ($55), they are all one day tours where you´ll enjoy <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama´s</a> incredible blessing of having primary forest 20 minutes away from the modern city. So many Panamanians forget about this! what a luxury to give for granted.</p>
<p>Here are some phone numbers for these groups:</p>
<p>Underground expedition to Lake Alajuela: panama_outdoors@yahoo.com  They tend to start the trip at 7 a.m.<br />
River Rafting at the Chagres National Park ($65 &#8211; $79): Phone (507) 261-5043 / 6668-1842<br />
Hiking, Snorkeling at Coiba National Park ($220 &#8230; believe me, this is a great price. Usually just the boat to get there is $800 alone&#8230; this includes transportation, food and a place to stay):  www.ecoviajerospanama.com</p>
<p>Now&#8230; where to stay budget in Casco Antiguo? Check out <a title="Luna´s Castle" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,9fe9620d-bc84-43ce-8f6b-3629c570747a.aspx" target="_blank">Luna´s Castle</a> or Hospedaje San Felipe.  Want to know what else is there in town? check out my Casco Antiguo<a title="Restaurants and Bars" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,322dec49-6a56-4b76-acdb-41737e2e1d6b.aspx" target="_blank"> restaurant and hotel reviews</a> here.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Global markets falling, the greatest economic recesion since the American Depresion... but Latin American Idol is here to save us! at least to remind us we still have what it takes to solve this. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo<br />
<a title="Panama, Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</a></p>
<p>I’m sure Margarita Henriquez had always entertained the idea of being a professional singer and at some point dreamed about being on stage. But in <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a>, especially at Los Santos, her home province in Panama, earning a living as a professional singer can be a challenging task, so most talented kids choose to study a “normal” profession and keep their dream as a hobby.</p>
<p>More over, making it as a singer outside Panama requires lots of talent, money, connections, luck, family &amp; friends support, prayers and a bunch of things that most people don’t have. And maybe, just maybe, you can attempt to compete in a market that is anyways flooded with a lot of highly produced artists and an ocean of people who frankly sound and feel just the same.</p>
<p>So ever since Spain came up with <a title="Operacion Triunfo" href="http://www.operaciontriunfo.com/" target="_blank">Operación Triunfo</a> (which was a local success that launched <a title="David Bisbal" href="http://www.davidbisbal.com/" target="_blank">David Bisbal</a>, the Spanish version of Ricky Martin) and United States copied the concept turning it into American Idol, common people felt they had the chance – at least – to get an audition in front of international judges. And the marketing experts in the States realized what a fantastic business they had just found! So eventually, Latin American Idol was born, and little Margarita was able to get her chance as well.</p>
<p>Without much pretension, and with a few supporters at first, she made it through the rounds along with another Panamanian. And that’s where it started to pick up. You see, Panama has had artists/ athletes who had made it in the international market before. But for a while, ever since Roberto Duran or Ruben Blades, Panamanians didn’t really have anyone to look up to. Two years ago, the <a title="Panama Music" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Rabanes" target="_blank">Rabanes</a> made it into the Grammys and this year <a title="Irving Saladino Olympics Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,518d9f14-4460-4a8c-a249-5b13a3f525b4.aspx" target="_blank">Irving Saladino</a> won gold medal in the Olympics. This started to trigger something long time forgotten in every Panamanian: a sense of unity. Suddenly it wasn’t only Margarita competing, it was Panama.</p>
<p>So when <a title="Margarita Panama American Idol" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob9CKh_3W3Y" target="_blank">Margarita </a>got closer to the finals, Panamanians got organized as they haven’t done since the Noriega´s time, when the nation gathered under the Civilista´s umbrella and stood up to the dictator. In less than a month, effective committees where put together to get votes, fund raising activities popped up everywhere, people voted, voted, voted and recruited others to vote.</p>
<p>Panamanians felt they had a chance, Margarita was doing well and although the Costa Rican girl was good, we could help her win, even if we had far less population than Costa   Rica. There where corporations making money and marketing the hell out of it in the back, but it wasn´t just that. You knew how important the snow ball had gotten for both countries and how much rating the show was generating when Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and Panamanian President Martin Torrijos appeared on screen at the final show to send their own personal cheering for each candidate.</p>
<p>You might think this is way too exaggerated and you might be right. And by the way, what does any of this has to do with the current recession, economic markets falling, people loosing their homes everywhere and the worst crisis we have seen since World War II. But here is the lesson we were reminded yesterday at Latin American Idol:</p>
<p>In all fairness, and risking to loose my Panamanian nationality, I think the Costa Rican girl had a better quality of voice. She was prettier too (not much of a dancer, though). Costa Rica, as a country is bigger and has a lot more people. But they lost. Why? They didn’t get organized. In this “war” Costa Rica had the statistical advantage, but Panama was united and more over… we cared. We where able to join hands and get things done.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, Panama, as a country, has done some amazing things when all Panamanians are on the same page and are emotionally involved in the cause. Without violence, we where able to stand up to Noriega (even if the United States had to do the final action of taking him to Miami) and we where able to re build a country from 20 years of dictatorship.</p>
<p>And historically speaking, the world has already done the same… and several times. After wars and depressions, cities and countries had just been forced to stand up together and make a big push into the same direction. Europe did it, the States did it.<span> </span>Humans have an infinite talent to recover and do fantastic things when they are united. And the most incredible thing is that the process makes them not only stronger, but wiser. Until the next generation … of course… where we forget to teach those lessons to the kids and history gets repeated.  But we call that destiny&#8230; right?</p>
<p>If anything, this crisis will help the world put its differences aside and realize we are all in the same boat. It will take some time to coordinate where to row, but we will row!  and the boat will go forward. Make no mistake on that!</p>

<p><br />
Last night was the opening night of Panama´s National Ballet performance of La Bayadere (known also as Bayaderka), the famous ballet from Marius Petipa where Prince Solor marries Princess Gamzatti, although he is really in love (and had sworn loyalty) to Nikiya, the temple dancer.</p>
<p>As many ballets from the romantic era, this one has all the elements: a very romanticized &#8220;kingdom in Arabia&#8221; with exotic customs in bright colors and equally colorful characters and at some point in the plot someone dies &#8211; of course- and the next act is danced under the moon in a contrasting scene of only blues and whites. In the particular case o Bayadere, after Solor realizes his mistake, in pain for the death of his beloved Nikiya he surrenders to the effects of the opium. Under it´s long tail of smoke, dancers appear as if they where in a dream, and only there he is able to meet Nikiya.</p>
<p>Alexa Gutierrez, from Panama, danced on Nikiya´s roll, one of my favorite I´ve seen from her so far. We danced Bayaderka together (loooong ago!!!!) when we where still part of the troupe, so it was a lot of fun to see her as soloist and the new &#8220;troupe&#8221; trying to coup up with the difficult coreography. Her counterpart, Ivana Kozomara from Belgrado, did a good job as the arrogant Gamzatti.</p>
<p>The performance was enjoyable and free! so don´t miss the next two nights. They are still on tonight and tomorrow. See more events in my <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama Events" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/eventscalendar.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo Calendar</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Event: </strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The dates are set: the 6th edition of the<a title="Panama Jazz Fest" href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/" target="_blank"> Panama Jazz Fest</a> to be held in 2009 will take place from January 12th to the 17th. This mega music event is a wonderful moment to enjoy the best of <a title="Panama Mini Cuba" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,c6faae68-2252-4978-9e81-46f82e2ffd0c.aspx" target="_blank">Panama´s culture,</a> which is more Caribbean than Central America (as geography might suggest. Panama´s flavor is more like Cuba than Costa Rica, for example) along with international jazz starts.  Paralel to the concert, the Fundacion Danilo Perez also runs workshops and gives music scholarships to Panamanian and latin american students to study in highly recognized music schools like the New England Conservatory, Berklee College of Music and the Conservatorio de Puerto Rico.  Even more, the Foundation is working hard to found its own music school in Panama. Where? &#8230;. in <a title="Panama Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>! of course. But where in Casco Viejo? hum&#8230;.

<p>Last night we were at the Panamanian´s Music Composer Fest at Plaza Catedral, <a title="Panama Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>. It was the perfect concert for a laid back Saturday: a group of Panamanian authors (and a Spanish guy named Jesus Garriga, from Canarias) singing their own songs with a guitar. It was the perfect romantic, sweet, cuddle-up-with-your-best-half concert of the year. Somehow, it had a good crowd, even if half of Panama was really at the Juanes Concert at Amador. Somehow I took this fantastic photo with my phone camera, I still don´t know how I did it&#8230; enjoy!</p>

<p>October is a special month for <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>, as it is the 100th anniversary month of Panama´s National Theatre. It started with the Pink Ribbon campaign (totally unrelated to the Theatre, however!) for breast cancer awareness, but it will continue with more interesting activities such as a special Gala Performance by the National Ballet of La Bayadere (featuring Alexa Gutierrez from Panama and Ivana Kozomara from Belgrado) and Madame Butterfly.   The first one is for free and the second one has tickets up to $100.</p>
<p>Outdoor concerts will have their share too with the Panamanian Author´s Festival, and independent music concerts like the Cuban artist X Alfonso, who is the author of the music at the film Habana Blues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo &#8211; <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</a></p>

<a class="thumbnail img-thumbnail" href='http://arcoproperties.com/en/casco-viejo-panama%c2%b4s-own-mini-havana-vieja/panpacificline/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/panpacificline-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>

<p>I first visited Havana Vieja in Cuba around 1996. I was involved in one of those student associations at the university (studying <a title="Patrizia CV" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/curriculums.aspx" target="_blank">Tourism Administration </a>or something of the sort) and one of our teachers,  who had studied diplomacy in Cuba (go figure!) encouraged us to organize a fair and invite someone in Cuba as a speaker. Somehow, because of our student status, we where able to get in touch with Osmany Cienfuegos, who happened to be no more and no less than Fidel Castro’s Ministry of Tourism and left hand. I guess this is the kind of thing you can pull off as a student, to be able to just “show up” and get the Ministry himself to meet with you. An extremely sharp guy, Osmany stormed into the room fully dressed in military gear and chewing a big habano. We didn’t get him as a speaker, but I can say we enjoyed the ride!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was a very interesting trip from which I learned a lot about our common roots, despite our different current political lives. <a title="Panama Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a> and Cuba are very much alike; our connection goes way back into the Spanish Colony times because of our common afroantillian culture. Cubans and Panamanians even speak similar. Of course, they speak faster and we eat more vowels, but the rhythm is pretty much the same (especially in Casco Viejo, check out my <a title="Casco Antiguo Phrasebook" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,30db5d0b-8657-4abc-b8f0-6d42f2975b5a.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo Phrasebook post</a>).  The famous Orisha religion has a lot of <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,71f3900e-812c-4ec1-b9ba-74f7fcf768dc.aspx" target="_blank">followers </a>here too, although they are more concealed and <span lang="EN-US">kill fewer chickens. We both love assigning nicknames to anything and anyone. If you are thin, you´ll be called flaco, if you are fat, we´ll call you gordo. Tío, jefe, compa, it isn´t personal, it is simply how we refer to people! </span></p>
<p>We are also globally known for our taste for African and salsa music (they might be the Guaguancó and salsa kings, but we are the cradle of reggaeton along with Puerto Rico!) … conclusion: give us rum and drums and we’ll make the party!</p>
<p>And don’t get a Cuban and a Panamanian (especially from Colon) to start a dance competition, you’ll be dizzy in two seconds! The Cuban salsa dancing style tends to be more acrobatic (with more pirouettes) but the Panamanian salsa style is more elegant and can get really sexy, depending on the province you are at. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans dancing style remind me of jumping beans. I guess the fast pace of Dominican´s merengue isn´t meant to be sexy at all. Serious Cubans and Panamanians are more into the craft of engaging and flirting with the partner. It is a bit like love making! Well, maybe not just a bit. For us, jumping misses the entire point of the dance.</p>
<p>But the similarities don’t stop there. During my trip I had the opportunity to visit their famous Havana Vieja and I was amazed. Amazed at the size of the city, as it is far bigger, but also amazed at how incredibly similar both cities are. It is a flavor you don’t find in Cartagena or in Antigua Guatemala.  These two cities are heavily Spanish Colonial, where every street (although very beautiful) looks exactly the same.  Cuba and Panama have highly diversified architectural styles, a reflection of our own society.</p>
<p>But it is here where our differences start.</p>
<p>Havana Vieja is huge, and is bordered by “Havana Moderna”, which is what followed up to the 50´s and never continued to evolve. In Panama, Casco Viejo is surrounded by different cities that weave and feed excitement into each other. Casco Antiguo is equidistant from a world class banking center, a thriving and cosmopolitan Panama City and the unique Canal Zone which is experiencing an interesting development fueled by the Panama Canal Expansion and visionary projects such as<a title="City of Knowledge" href="http://www.cdspanama.org/index.php?set_language=en&amp;cccpage=index" target="_blank"> City of Knowledge </a>and Howard. The country itself is an easy port to arrive to and to depart from. Panama has become a regional hub, where big headquarters like Procter and Gamble have moved to, but also interesting NGO´s like UNICEF, United Nations just to mention a few.</p>
<p>While researching about Havana and Casco Antiguo, I found this poster announcing trips from the United States (California and New York) to Panama and then to Havana by ship. What a trip that must have been. Weeks in a boat to come from the cold to tropical paradise, I’m sure if you took the “fast boat” you could make it in a month&#8230;and no fooling around! Today, things are so different and in so many angles. Time is gold and most things most be achieved in no time or less. Your travel option has to be interestingly diverse, compact, accessible and safe.</p>
<p>So, where can you get the “Cuban” flavor, base at a 300 year old colonial town while exploring at the same time beach, island and mountain and still manage to get your business done in less than five days?</p>
<p>Only in Casco Antiguo, Panama, of course…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo  &#8211;  Casco Antiguo, <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">San Felipe</a></p>

<p>The countdown for Quantum of Solace has begun!: the Odeon cinema will show Daniel´s Craig movie featuring also my favorite of all times Dame Judi Dench, our beloved bad guys Mathieu Amalric and crazy (we love you too!) Anatole Taubman and on the roll of James Bond Girl  the beautiful Olga Kurylenko. October 29th is the &#8220;H&#8221; Day, the night before the official opening at United Kingdom. Panama will be hooked to every press release, image, youtube pirated video&#8230;  As you may know already it was filmed in Casco Viejo and being such a small town (and country), everyone was either in the movie or working for production. And we´ll all go to see it &#8230; again and again and again&#8230;. Can´t wait!</p>
<p>See pictures <a title="James Bond Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,9793dfa5-d24b-4e0b-bd70-14393d6eab46.aspx" target="_blank">HERE</a> when they where filming in Casco Antiguo, Panama.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"><a title="Casco Antiguo Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Panama, Casco Antiguo<br />
Casco Viejo, San Felipe<br />
</a><br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Yesterday I was running to meet a client and suddenly got caught in the middle of this great religious parade. Kids dressed in white, they where at the front of the Virgen de la Merced (My Lady of La Merced) which was being carried all through Avenida A, from 9th street to first street and then back to La Merced church (see a virtual tour <a title="La Merced Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/citibak.aspx" target="_blank">here of where </a>the crowd ended the procession)  People singing, and of course, the band which is omnipresent. But in the specific case of La Merced Virgin, there is a sutile presence between the followers for those who can see it.</span></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">So it happens that Panama is a fully Caribbean culture. I´ve never grown tired of saying it, because it is so true and explains so much. One of the things that connect Caribbean cultures is their love for Orishas, which in some countries is called the Santeria religion, more famously present in Cuba and in Brazil, but that really travelled from Africa at the times of the Spanish conquest. Those black descendants that settled in the Caribbean islands later came to Panama to work in the Canal, and therefore their cultural traditions where brought with them and spread throughout the population.</p>
<p>As a result, a lot of Panamanians have a &#8220;santero&#8221; de confianza (of trust) or at least knows someone or knows someone that knows someone. In Casco Antiguo, where roots are more authentic, most people have their protector in the Orishas. Changó, Yemanja and Oshun between the most popular. One of the mechanics back in the slave trade times to protect the followers from the Spanish punishment was to conceal their beliefs into a Catholic figure. Oshun, for example, became the Lady of La Merced, from what they call &#8220;La Caridad del Cobre&#8221; (Cooper´s Charity). </p>
<p>Her color is yellow and white (which is the general color of Santeria and Santeros), she is supposed to rule all things sweet and beautiful, is the love goddess, although as story goes she is never lucky as she gets hurt constantly. I think she was wife of Chango or something like that. Her elements are honey and sunflowers. People go to her to ask for a home, either new or a protection for it. If you ever go to La Merced church, you´ll see small &#8220;house&#8221; toys under the feet of the virgin´s statue. I´m not sure the priest really knows why they are there and why he has such a big following&#8230;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A classic Monday morning in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>: I was on the phone and at the same time answering emails (or deleting early spam… somehow the prince of Mombatu is still considering sending me at least $200,000 directly to my bank account, no papers signed) when suddenly a loud noise started to approach. “Drums…. Drums in the deep”… I thought, just like the Lord of the Rings episode when the good guys where about to get attacked by ugly orks. I couldn’t continue my phone conversation, so I hung up and ran outside with my camera… quickly, but not quickly enough, as the parade had already passed <a title="Calle 1era, Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/arcoproperties.aspx" target="_blank">Calle 1era</a>. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I ran through the alley to catch them at Calle 2nda, but then found out they where staying at <a title="Plaza Francia Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/bovedas.aspx" target="_blank">Plaza Francia</a>, so I had to run again to get a good shot before they disolved the formation.<span>  </span>And there they were: all dressed up in their school uniforms, heads high under the morning sun, a parade to commemorate the “Book Awareness Week”. A few local schools where part of it, Escuela de Mexico and I think I saw the Simon Bolivar as well.<span>  </span>The parade had two great signs: “To respect other people’s rights is to have peace” and “The books are our teachers”. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I’m glad schools take these small but significant opportunities to blend fun with great messages. For the kids is all about the honor of being in “the band”, but I know somewhere in the middle of it, a mind is being shaped. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The Book Awareness Week has started! If you are in the community and would like to donate books, don’t be shy and ask any of the local schools. Some have small libraries and they would love to receive donations. Or go to Parque Omar on Saturday, as they are collecting books to distribute to schools and use in their art workshops.</span></span></span></p>

<a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>, San Felipe</p>
<p>Last week the world went bananas on the trade market. A rollercoaster that has more than one at the edge of a heart attack, it has been really worrysome for all of us to see gigants fall and take with them everything they can. Markets in Asia, Japan and Europe have been affected. As a journalist said, &#8220;when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold&#8221;. </p>
<p>In <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama, </a>however, things have been slightly different. The week closed at our very petit trade market with earnings. Banks have become more conservative and strict on their analysis of their clients, but they where very conservative from the beginning, so there wasn´t much of a surprise here. And even more surprisingly, according to today´s La Prensa article by Raul Bernal, the public trust on Panamanian economy has raised to 101.8 points, 11.9 points over last July, and between the bonus payments (in Panama you get 3 bonuses throughout the year) and the upcoming holidays, they expect the indicators to raise or at least keep the same level.</p>
<p>When addressing the &#8220;trust&#8221; issue on a radio program last week, Felipe Chapman, one of the most balanced economist I know in Panama and  vice-president of <a title="Panama Bond Market" href="http://www.panabolsa.com/sys/index.php?id=cccpageqp0qpjd" target="_blank">Panama&#8217;s stock and bond exchange</a>, said that it is the basis of the entire economic pyramid. Without it, there is nothing, and where there was something, they just ignore it by putting everyone on the same basket. The public is untrustful of all these companies who have taken too much risks with their money. In some cases, they are completely right: some companies (and some clients!) where cowboys. But in others, as an analyst friend of mine pointed out, the market is punishing some companies that have performed very well, but since there is so much fear, they rather take everyone down. &#8220;And here is where I buy&#8221; he said. Why? because the fundamental value of the business is still there, it never changed. They´ll weather the storm and will still be there when everything corrects. And I will enjoy my earnings. And so he should: his vision was never fogged by general panic. With a cold mind, he disects companies into fundamentals (that include human behavior and economic analysis), take the noise out, the panic, emotions, and looks at logical future scenarios. And looks at what is really there now (which is equally important). Then, he makes a decision and buys.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had a conversation with a client who rushed in absolute panic about the markets. Asking me a thousand questions about what to do with his property (he bought a very nice property which he intends to open commercially) and if I thought he would succeed.  And here is where I remember my analytical friend and mr. Chapman.  It is the same as analyzing a company in the stock market. Where and what are the fundamentals? of the country, of your particular business? why would Panama, the particular property you own and your business be still on the right side of the street, even when the world has dark clouds all over?</p>
<p>I told him, &#8220;look&#8230; I am not saying Panama won´t be touched by this economic disaster. What I trully believe is that Panama is a micro niche, and as so, the hurricane will be felt a little less here. This is where you are going to weather the storm better. Why? you have fundamentals here that are strong and very particular events that are lifting this economy and will continue to do so at least on the next 5 to 10 years.&#8221;.</p>
<p>One of the important things that Felipe Chapman pointed out in the radio program is that Panama never invested in the US subprime, nor on its mortgage packages. I guess because we are such a small country, or maybe because our internal market for mortgages is so strong, Panamanian banks just never did. Therefore, it won´t affect directly the Panamanian Banking system like it has happened in Europe and Asia.  Just there, you have a hugh advantage. We will be affected by a slowness in consumption from US and European clients. Or maybe with the weakening dollar, some other markets will open.</p>
<p>But even if those fail, we have two big elements doing the heavy lifting for the next 5 to 10 years: the Panama Canal Expansion is a reality and it is atracting a lot of people to relocate here to work in every level. The works are supposed to be done in 8 years, this country being Panama it will be 10.  We have also the oil refinery project in Puerto Armuelles, with almost double the investment of the Panama Canal Expansion. The second element is the relocation of regional headquarters of very important companies and institutions such as Dell, Caterpillar, Maersk, Procter and Gamble, Aventis, UNICEF, United Nation´s Food Programmee between others. Those guys move a lot of executives around the region and they are based in Panama.</p>
<p>If you think those three elements shouldn´t be enough to lift an economy, remember this: Panama has only 3 million habitants in the entire country. Probably the capital is a million! And growing, since we are receiving a lot of Venezuelans, which are relocating with their families and businesses. Just as it happened a 100 years ago when the Panama Canal was getting built, all the people relocating (not just &#8220;passing through&#8221;) will inject energy and resources into the country in order not only to survive but to make good living.</p>
<p>Going back to my friend with his property in <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>. If Panama as a country is one of your best bets to weather the storm, Casco Viejo within Panama (and I would almost say the region) is your best bet&#8230; period. If you have something unique, you are in far better position than having something &#8220;copy/paste&#8221;.  Unique, beautiful, historic, and in a site that invites to consumption as the ambiance is just delicious and full of textures.  Conveniently located 10 minutes away from the modern Panama City and 6 minutes away from the ex &#8220;Canal Zone&#8221; it is the best position to benefit from the Panama Canal Expansion, the tourism (internal or external) of Panama City. It is already the second tourism destination within the city (the first one is the Panama Canal) and the logic party and entertainment point for all those executives and families that have moved and continue to move down here. And since his business includes a lot of beer&#8230; my logical conclusion is that he´ll be just fine! </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">When Al Gore launched his “ Inconvenient Truth” he touched many nerves world wide. Liked it or not, people reacted in such a way that has forced all relevant presidential candidates (Barak Obama, John Mccain &#8230; I wished I could add any of the running Panamanian candidates to the list, but so far they haven´t shown much interest. Panamanians on the other hand, have become increasingly active!) to take note of these issues seriously. <span lang="EN-US">Just today (and to make things worst) I opened the newspaper and read how hurricane Ike has at least a dozen of refineries closed in the United States. In <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a>, we aren´t exposed to hurricanes, but we are certainly sensible to the repercusions of oil price fluctuations, just like anywhere else. Repercusions are endless. </span>The energy crisis is real. But what about the food crisis? </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The cost of everything is increasing worldwide. What can we do? We ride more buses, use less cars, it’s logical. But what about food? Should I just buy less of what I need?<span>  </span>One of the answers could be, grow it yourself. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">This isn’t a crazy idea just out of the hat, nor it will solve the problem by itself. Or maybe it can if its done well.  Many are doing it, with great results. All around Europe, there is not a single free space near the neighborhood parks that isn’t somehow used for <a title="Urban Agriculture in Europe" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,57f30a5e-bd4a-45d3-b364-f2cdeef0a58b.aspx" target="_blank">urban agriculture</a>. And it works from many angles. It generates food from land that would usually not be used for anything in particular other than simple “enjoyment” (in the case of <a title="Plaza Bolivar Virtual Tour" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/plazabolivar.aspx" target="_blank">plazas</a>, for example). But also, since those gardens are maintained by retirees and children, they give a sense of purpose to the first and teach the right lessons to the second. It also rounds up calories and proteins, and helps us get through this crisis in a better shape. When well done, it even gives us certain independence from the fluctuating prices. </span></span></span></p>

And good to cook chicken as well), a zucchini, passion fruit, a tilo plant (also for tea) and some stuff I don’t even know what they are since they are growing directly from <a title="My composter Casco Viejo balcony" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,da5f3f59-6ff6-4218-95d6-cdce56f43a81.aspx" target="_blank">my composter </a>and they need to grow a bit more to be identified. Starting is as easy as throwing your organic garbage into <a title="Urban Composter Winners" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,74c69b3f-7a37-46f4-b4c6-12ed2ab6964e.aspx" target="_blank">a pot with dirt </a>and steering it from time to time. You’ll reduce waste and suddenly discover that some of the seeds (probably tomatoes will go first) will start growing. </span></span></span></p>

The chronics say that when the Spanish came to America, the Indians had tons of different plants and fruits they didn´t even know. After the success of crops like corn, potatoes and tomatoes, many of these plants where left aside. Very nutritious options once common and well known have fallen into oblivion, either by ignorance or because they where genetically mixed to produce more resistant variations. </span></span></span></p>

<a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>, San Felipe</p>
<p>The World Bank is investing heavily in <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a>. Yesterday, they announced that they are considering a $400 million dollar financing for the Panama Canal Expansion project.   The project is currently budgeted at $5,250 million dollars. So many zeros in those numbers I don´t even know what it means anymore. However, according to the note at La Prensa, the announcement was made in Washington by the President of the World Bank, Luis Alberto Moreno, during the visit of the President of Panama, Martin Torrijos.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal Expansion has a list of exclusive investors such as: the European Investment Bank (who has offered $700 million dollars) and the Corporacion Andina de Fomento (who has put $500 in the pot). I guess we have another $4,050 million dollars to go! should we organize a TShirt sale or a theatre night to raise funds?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panama is a very romantic place if you put it together right. How to organize a romantic and interesting getaway? This combination of history, ethnic experience, beach and mountain is my personal favorite! ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal">Panama, Casco Antiguo &#8211;  Casco Viejo, San Felipe</p>
<figure id="attachment_462" style="width: 243px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/casco-antiguo-love.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-462" title="casco-antiguo-love" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/casco-antiguo-love.jpg" alt="Casco Antiguo Love! " width="243" height="180" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Casco Antiguo Love! </figcaption></figure>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is so hard to combine experiences in a vacation trip. You want it all, and you only have a week (or less). So you can´t take chances, you want everything to be just right. While there is no way this is a foolproof combination, I think this combination is my favorite. You can do it all in a week or less, it depends on how much you want to learn and experience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">It all starts and ends in Panama City, and nowhere else but in our romantic <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>. It is the perfect place for afternoon strolling, hand by hand with your beloved best half. Even when it rains is romantic. Each building tells a story of beauty, as I recently read in a book called “The architecture of happiness” (which by the way is not a self help book, is an architecture and philosophy book) there is a very human relationship between emotions and forms, where we as humans translate an emotion into certain types of shapes. If that is so, each building in Casco truly “speaks” to you of happiness, poetry and personality. Every <a title="Plaza Bolivar Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/plazabolivar.aspx" target="_blank">plaza,</a> every tree. But lets get to concrete stuff. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">#1 How to get the best out of Casco Viejo while you are here on vacations? Your romantic getaway in Panama must start by staying at an apartment or a hotel in Casco Antiguo. There are very few, so be sure to book in advance. If you really want to impress your girl, go for the <a title="Canal House Panama" href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com" target="_blank">Canal House Panama </a>. You may also rent short term rental apartments like <a title="Apartment Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/renting-historic.aspx" target="_blank">Café de Asis</a> or <a title="Cuatro Tulipanes" href="http://www.loscuatrotulipanes.com/" target="_blank">Los 4 Tulipanes</a>. Romantic backpackers might stay at Hostal San Felipe or Luna’s Castle. Romance comes in every budget! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">The best of Casco are mornings and evenings. Midday in Panama in general tends to be really hot, so be prepared with hats and sunscreen lotion. Evenings especially, have a rhythm of their own. Strolling is the local prefered activity .Have an ice cream at Grandclement in Calle 3era and A Avenue and check out if there is anything going on that afternoon at Casa Gongora or at the <a title="National Theatre" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,5d136378-831b-4134-b293-e8c6cc336989.aspx" target="_blank">National Theatre</a>. Then walk under the bougainvilleas at Calle 1era and go all around <a title="Las Bovedas Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/bovedas.aspx" target="_blank">Las Bovedas</a>. You’ll see the entrance of the Panama  Canal and the ships in line to cross it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">When it comes to activities, there is always something going on in Casco Viejo, although it is very uncommon to have a thousand things at the same time. We take it easy here…. But there are some steady nights: Wednesdays and Fridays are jazz and bolero nights at Gongora. If you are here in a weekend, after dinner you should head to Platea. They usually have live bands from Thursdays to Saturdays. Jazz on Thursdays, salsa on Fridays, and rock on Saturdays. For more bohemian souls, then La Casona might be your best spot, at Plaza Herrera. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Cocktail time is my personal favorite, when the sun goes down. Check out the different restaurants at Plaza Bolivar. Nothing like having a mojito and mixed ceviche at Ego. You can choose to have tapas all night under the stars or walk to another restaurant to have dinner. There are at least eight restaurants in the area, ranging from Spanish to Brazilian. Al fresco or not, your choice!. Check out my reviews <strong><a title="Restaurants and Bars" href="http://cascoviejopanama.wikispaces.com/Restaurants+and+Bars+Casco+Viejo" target="_blank">here</a> </strong>for most of them. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US"> # 2 But the best of Casco Viejo is that is the perfect base to visit the rest of the country. Feel free to explore the mountains, the beaches, the islands. The local airport is 15 minutes away from Casco, which means Chiriquí “sweater weather” is an hour away, Bocas del Toro white beach sands are also an hour away and the Kuna Indians at San Blas islands are … well, in fact, they are right outside your door, as they are always selling their best crafts in the Casco.<span> </span> Here are my personal romantic picks throughout the country:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Bocas del Toro: <a title="All Natural Bastimentos" href="http://www.bocas.com/alnatura.htm" target="_blank">All Natural</a> in Bastimentos. At night, don´t miss the fluorescent weed in the ocean. At night, when there isn´t full moon, the sky is an explosion of stars. But then, as you sit on their dock, take a flashlight and point it out to the water. You´ll see how the water responds in a bunch of little stars of its own!  Tip: if you don´t mind cold water (skinny dipping allowed!) go into the water with a snorkel and a mask. If someone flashes from outside, you´ll see yourself surrounded by tons of little bright dots!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Bastimentos is an island a bit away from <a title="Boca Town" href="http://www.epinions.com/content_178936581764" target="_blank">Isla Colon (Boca Town)</a> where the action is. You can combine staying a night or two at the town so you can party and then go to All Natural to relax. My heart is with Om Cafe for indian food. Those breakfasts are good.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Chiriqui:  if in Boquete, I would stay at a coffee farm. My best pick: go hiking at La Amistad park. It is great weather and if you are quiet and lucky enough, you´ll see the Quetzal. But even if you don´t see them, you can enjoy hearing them: they have a distinctinve flute sound. You´ll be in the middle of the cloud forest surrounded by flutes. Especially in October, when they mate. Go to Volcan or Cerro Punta and have strawberries with cream. There is a spa called Los Quetzales with an outdoor jacuzzi. You can arrange a great massage and use their installations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Note: the road from Chiriquí to Bocas is one of the most beautiful trips in Panama. However, notice buses between the two provinces drive like crazy, so be careful. You can see the transition between wonderful cloud forest (mountain) to fully tropical rainforest in less than 2 hours.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">San Blas: Haven´t been there in a while, but wherever you go make sure you hire a boat to go &#8220;island hopping&#8221;. You should not miss Isla Tigre, as it is the more traditional one, a splash of mola and color. If you go during Carnivals (which I did many years ago) it is fantastic, they have their own version and is great.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">You can do as much or as little as you want. Panama’s beautiful diversity is at your reach.  On your way back, be sure to have a reservation for a massage at the Canal House in Casco Antiguo. Without rushing, without hurrying, unless you want to. And don´t worry if you can´t do it all in one trip!</p>

<p>&#8220;A Cultural Cornerstone&#8221; is today´s New York Times travel article about <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx">Casco Viejo, Panama</a>, featuring our favorite hotel <a title="Canal House Panama" href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/" target="_blank">Canal House Panama</a> as editor´s pick and businesses like Karavan Gallery and Indigo Restaurant. Check out the article <a title="New York Times Panama Article" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/travel/14surfacing.html" target="_blank">HERE </a>. </p>
<p>I believe travel journalists in New York Times understand very well today´s traveler who looks for an authentic place, an experience that has both a level of sophistication but yet is at the same time unpolished. Just like the article cites Cuba, Casco Antiguo in Panama shares common <a title="Caribbean Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,8ab838fe-ef94-46ad-8eb6-ef7cc914a5d4.aspx" target="_blank">architectural styles </a>and cultural characteristics. Plus&#8230; it is legal! and for <a title="Real Estate Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/howto.aspx" target="_blank">real estate</a>, it is cheaper than any of its revitalized peers in the region.</p>
<p>But frankly, the best is to live here. Why? the international airport is 20 minutes away and COPA is a fantastic airline that takes me to most destinations I want to go to. Internet connection is great, the neighborhood is beautiful, cost of living is better than in the States so I can afford a maid (I´m sure others would include a cook and or a chofer) and the community is interesting. You can make a positive impact here. On the weather, Casco Viejo´s old stones receive sun all year round and rain half of the year but only for an hour at a time and once a day. At night, I walk out to have good dinner and / or have a Zacapa rhum at one of the <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,69a87252-8215-4762-a146-2bd823cd68e1.aspx" target="_blank">neighborhood bars</a>. Or if there´s an event going on, I just walk there and back. Like last night, there was a rock concert at <a title="Plaza Herrera" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/boyaca.aspx" target="_blank">Plaza Herrera</a>, 7 minutes away by feet. And if I want more of a modern city flavor&#8230; well, I just get my car and drive less than 15 minutes. I´m right into Panama´s nightlife district. Although I have to warn you, as a friend told me last night: why would I ever leave Casco Viejo? everything happens right here&#8230;  </p>

<p>An ambitious project is being launched by the World Bank and the <a title="Panama Office of Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,ba606dc8-070c-486d-b279-a1734df8acd8.aspx" target="_blank">Oficina del Casco Antiguo.</a> About $2M will be invested in the creation and promotion of cultural industries only in the Casco. Of course, as Casco Antiguo is the second touristic destination (but only after the Panama Canal) this makes a world of sense: cultural activities and tourism in many other countries represent an amazing percentage of their economy and <a title="Panama Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> in Panama is in the best position to develop them.</p>
<p>The project will be in different phases. The idea would be to attract cultural entrepreneurs to Casco Antiguo, art schools and artisans. The Office of Casco Antiguo will launch the first calling for applicants and cultural proposals soon. So far, they have already signed an agreement with Fundes, which would provide business guidance to the entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Panama´s art<a title="Panama Art Bienal" href="http://www.bienalpanama.org/index1_I.html" target="_blank"> Bienal </a>is probably one of the most important events in the year for painting, plastic arts and media. This year, the theme is the ex &#8220;Canal Zone&#8221;. Its history and influence in our society. The making of the Panama Canal and its political and social interaction as a &#8220;nation within a nation&#8221; literally shaped Panama in obvious ways&#8230; but also in very subtle ways.</p>
<p>Artists are from different countries, Belgium, Mexico, Ecuador USA, UK, Germany, Eslovaquia, New Zeland and &#8230; of course&#8230; Panama. Zonians and not. The exhibition at the Contemporary Art Museum is focused on &#8220;El dulce olor a quemado de la historia&#8221; (The sweet smell of burnt history) a concept from the Mexican curator Magali Arriola.</p>
<p>The themes range from the martyrs of our independence (a Chinese guy and his donkey&#8230; hey, I´m not making this up. They where the only 2 casualties of our independence from Colombia) to the battle with yellow fever which made the country even possible.</p>
<p>Other activities such as Brook Alfaro´s exhibition will be held in different points of the city. And a week of documentaries will be held at the Guild Theatre, Panama´s only English Speaking Theatre.  <a title="Panama Art Bienale" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,dd41b755-e4e5-48d4-8c2d-5465ac190ad1.aspx" target="_blank">Click Here</a> for the calendar for the documentaries. They are very interesting and show amazing footage of inside and outside the Canal Zone back in the 70´s.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Flash announcement!  <span lang="EN-US">The Dutch – French airline (Air France – KLM) announced that they’ll add 2 more regular flights to Panama, starting December 01<sup>st</sup>, 2008. According to Axel Metselaar, general manager of the firm in Panama, their decision was based on the increase of demand due to the works at the Panama Canal Expansion, which has attracted several European companies and has put the word out for Panama as a tourism destination. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> And what destination within Panama City is quoted by all the studies of the Tourism Bureau as the second most visited ?  (and only second to the Panama Canal itself)&#8230;<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx"> Casco Viejo !</a> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to the note at La Prensa, the occupation level at KLM has reached 92% and keeps growing which totally contradicts the world’s tendency to cut out flights instead of reopening them. </span></p>

<p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Last week I met with a young couple who spent about a week in Panama on vacations. They had a fantastic time running from our beloved 300 year old historic town to the mountains to the beach and the islands in the Caribbean (all in less than a week) and at the end of their trip they wanted to know if they could <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/buying-historic.aspx" target="_blank">buy something </a>in Casco Viejo. There are no legal limitations for foreigners to buy property in Panama (especially in Casco Antiguo). <span> </span>But with time running short, there wasn’t much they could do other than get familiarized with the process and get them settled with a piece of the basics. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">So, if you are planning to travel to Panama and exploring real estate will probably be part of the fun, this is the people you’ll need to meet: </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<ol style="margin-top:0;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A good realtor: If your time is limited, your best option in order to get to know the place and be presented with a range of choices is a good realtor. Don’t be dazzled by good language skills, ask questions, follow your instinct. Once you identified the property you might like, then your next interview will be…. </span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A good lawyer: This is essential, as contracts are usually in Spanish and depending on what you would like to buy there might be title issues. In Casco Viejo, real estate is so old that is very easy to do due diligence. Be more attentive on coasts and islands, as there is a lot of what we call “derechos posesorios” or “rights of possession” which in most cases means you are buying air. <span> </span>This is not a problem in Casco Antiguo, as the title is clearly defined in what we call the Public Registry. </span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A good bank: Once you identified a property, you might need a bank account to be able to buy it. Some lawyers offer escrow services, for which the deposit at signature can be done through them. But the closing needs usually a letter of payment from a local bank, so you’ll need the account anyways. Banks will require a list of things, mostly references to comply with the “know your client” policy that was installed after September 11<sup>th</sup>. </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">About the references: Most banks will ask for a letter of reference from a bank back at home. So if you can travel with this and a commercial letter (both in original) you might be in good shape for your interview. Everything else can be sent afterwards. They usually require a copy of your passport, the letters of references, and maybe a job letter if you are on salary. If you work independently they’ll ask you about your company, it might be a good idea to have some material about it. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Now, if you are planning to get a mortgage, here are the documents they might ask in advance. They ask for them in original, so make several packages to apply to different banks at the same time. Here is what they’ll ask for:</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>Personal balance sheet with evidence (bank statements or appraisals)</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>Income tax for the last two years</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>Complete copy of passport </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>Copy of another ID </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>2 reference letters from your bank (date when the relationship started, average balance of the last six months and the balance at the date they issue the letter)</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>2 personal reference letters from a local person or from a prominent member of your community.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>Completed and signed application.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;" lang="EN-US">*<span>          </span>Credit Score</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[I suddenly realized Casco Viejo might be in the middle of the most important Presidential Campaign of our times: John McCain vs Barak Obama. How?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"></p>
<figure id="attachment_429" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/historic-aerial-casco-viejo-panama.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-429" title="historic-aerial-casco-viejo-panama" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/historic-aerial-casco-viejo-panama.jpg" alt="Casco Viejo Panama Historic " width="309" height="264" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Casco Viejo Panama Historic </figcaption></figure>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">I’ve been following the passionate political campaign between Barak Obama and John McCain for a while. As a Panamanian, I find it inspirational how each side juggles strategy and marketing while trying not to be dishonest to each side’s profound beliefs. But suddenly, in the middle of all these deep thoughts, it struck me. And I laughed. Panama, this small, petite country has a way of getting in the middle of giants and become a crucial participant in the world’s most important events.</p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Let me explain. Under the law of “Six Degrees Separation”, Panama is of course related to the entire world. According to scientific research, by closing the gap between North America and South America it allowed for warm waters to bounce up to Europe and melt, and therefore allow life in what is today France and the European Coast. I’m not making this up, this is a scientific fact. Ask scientists at Smithsonian. They’ve been studying this forever. So, as French claim to be the cradle of civilization, Panama might claim to be the geological cradle for France. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">As if this wasn´t enough,</span><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> Panama gets itself in the middle of the most exciting presidential race in US history by the simple fact that one of the candidates parents happen to have sex in Panama back in 1939. Think about it. What were the chances? Panama’s population is not even a sneeze compared to United States population. From all those people, there are a limited number who would run for political positions. Statistically, even less get to be Senators. And the chances for this person to run for President are quite small. But to run for one of the main candidates! That is simply incredible. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">But what is even more entertaining is to think what John McCain parent’s life most have been in Panama back in 1935. And the reason I go back is because recently a Panamanian group put up a <a title="Historic Database Panama" href="http://www.sibiup.up.ac.pa/indexsibiup.html" target="_blank">historic database </a>online with amazing originals and articles back from colonial days. You can read first hand newspapers as back as 1930´s.<span>  </span>So, on top of my affirmation of “John McCain’s parents had sex in Panama” (yeah, I know, it was the “Canal Zone” by then, so he might dispute whether it was United States territory) I an going to say that at some point the chances where quite high that the McCains actually had sex in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Here´s my theory: Back in 1930´s life in Panama was very simple. The Canal Zone was running as usual, and Panama City consisted only of Casco Viejo. There wasn’t much more other than the countryside. Places like Paitilla, Costa del Este and further where cattle pasture. Bella Vista was where the wealthy would have their country mansions. It was really different, check out the photo above.<span>   </span>It was so basic, that the military had cinemas inside their camps; they had bowling, restaurants and other entertainment areas. But they often got bored and went into Casco Viejo, especially <a title="Santa Ana Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/santaana.aspx" target="_blank">Santa Ana</a>, to have a good time. The database shows several articles advertising “cantinas” or bars, discos, elegant places side by side with the not so elegant. Business was so good even my grandfather ran one of them; it was called “Cantina Nueva York” (or New York Bar). So, as a young soldier with his wife, visiting Casco Viejo wouldn’t be unusual.  And splurging for a romantic night in one of the fancy hotels that then dotted the Casco Viejo? Why not? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">And that’s where I laughed. Because I have decided to choose to believe that John McCain was born in the Canal Zone but “assembled” in Casco Viejo. Just like my dad. In Panama, that practically make us relatives! </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo &#8211; Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>
<figure id="attachment_426" style="width: 227px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/copia-de-brooke-alfaro-003.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-426" title="copia-de-brooke-alfaro-003" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/copia-de-brooke-alfaro-003.jpg" alt="Brook Alfaro painting of Woman From Chorrillo " width="227" height="448" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/copia-de-brooke-alfaro-003.jpg 227w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/copia-de-brooke-alfaro-003-152x300.jpg 152w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Brook Alfaro painting of Woman From Chorrillo </figcaption></figure>
<p>The first time I met <a title="Brook Alfaro" href="http://www.freewaves.org/artists/b_alfaro/" target="_blank">Brook Alfaro </a>was at least ten years ago. He was recently moving into his apartment in Casco Viejo, and he was one of the first founders of <a title="Fundacion Calicanto" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,adfd2702-db6d-42c7-834c-d9bfe2e3f040.aspx" target="_blank">Fundacion Calicanto</a>, which at the time was fighting to include Casco Antiguo into <a title="Casco Antiguo History" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">UNESCO´s World Heritage Sites</a>. It was probably also the first time I walked into a true artist´s studio. His apartment was very beautiful, but I didn´t really notice (until after, of course). What got me was his painting room, with the canvases on work. Color everywhere, as I have never seen before that time. I have always had this fascination with work &#8220;on the works&#8221; &#8230; what was it before it got completed. And on both ends &#8221; on the works&#8221; and &#8220;finished&#8221;, Brook´s paintings make an impact.</p>
<p>He´s themes where always very human, mostly inspired in the people of San Felipe, <a title="Santa Ana" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/santaana.aspx" target="_blank">Santa Ana </a>and Chorrillo. At some point, he decided to explore other media and went radically different: he went to digital and video. A part of me was dissapointed since I´m such a fan of his paintings, but another part of me said: &#8220;well, about time a good professional guy raised the bar in art video in Panama&#8221;. And he did, also exposing the raw parts of our society.</p>
<p>As a person, Brook can be overlooked, with his big eyes and curly white hair, you know he is in art but you are not quite sure in which one. His temperament is so mellow and relaxed that the last thing you can imagine is that he is the author of such hurricanes of painted (or filmed) emotions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, with great pleasure, I see him again in the cover of La Prensa´s &#8220;K&#8221; magazine. He is back into painting. Although he moved out of <a title="San Felipe, Plaza Bolivar" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/sanfranciscodeasis.aspx" target="_blank">San Felipe </a>(but still kept his apartment!), he never left it. His inspiration is still in the same spot, as it has proven to be so rich. This time, he is exploring portraits. He has come back with his classic combination of humor and intensity. Or just humor or just intensity. He might play either one or at the same time!</p>
<p>Welcome back Brook, we missed you. And thanks for the good work!</p>

<p>Last night, the United Nations Environmental Programee inaugurated at the National Theatre in Casco Antiguo their <a title="Eco Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,487cef03-792b-4212-aabf-908f1b9bfe4d.aspx" target="_blank">&#8220;For the Earth&#8221; Festival</a>. It will last a month, with several activities within <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>, ranging from poetry to rock concerts. Most of the activities will be held at the Anita Villalaz Theatre.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the inauguration reception. It started with a concert by Panama´s National Orquestra and ended with a cocktail at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs located at the lovely Plaza Bolivar. It is an amazing building. I was glad to see a full house last night, and familiar faces from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (Juan Maté got awarded for his research in Panama, congratulations!) and other environmental NGO´s.</p>
<p>Tonight they´ll be inaugurating an art gallery in Las Bovedas, next to the Ministry of Culture. This gallery will host workshops about art and recycling during the festival for children. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[A new client recently asked me “Is Casco Viejo gay friendly?” For a moment I had to think about the question. You see, growing up as a ballet dancer I never even gave a thought to it. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Panama, Casco Viejo &#8211; </span><span lang="EN-US">Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A new client recently asked me “Is <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>gay friendly?” <span> </span>For a moment I had to think about the question. You see, growing up as a ballet dancer I never even gave a thought to it. <span> </span>Half of the male dancers were gay, although probably we didn’t have any lesbians back then. We used to base from the <a title="National Theatre" href="https://www.salesforce.com/login.jsp" target="_blank">National Theatre </a>at Casco Viejo, and although we only stayed there for a couple of years it was simply delightful. <span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">I was a teenager back then, so I didn’t really noticed why Casco Antiguo was so enjoyable. I could point out to my background as my family lived here and obviously felt a connection but it wasn’t only that. It is the fact that everyone can be whatever they want to be here and no one thinks about it twice. It is so densely diverse (both architecturally and socially) that adding another color to this already bright palette is the natural thing to do, it makes it more interesting and cheerful; so you are never out of tone. You are part of the tone. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Somehow, Casco Viejo as a city feels so good in its own skin that it just embraces the entire rainbow of options. Bars like La Casona or Baños Publicos have become the classic hang out spot for artists of all sorts and even those who (like me) can’t paint a rainbow but still have a bohemian, adventurous soul. <span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">If you are wondering about how nightlife is here, check out my reviews and explore! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong><span>What to do? Restaurants, bars, theatres </span></strong></span><span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong></strong><span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> Panama, Casco Viejo<br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe<br />
</p>
<p><a title="Casco Antiguo Beach Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,370f0310-d724-42c4-9021-1122e3c3ebc4.aspx" target="_blank">Santo Domingo Beach </a>is the closest beach in Panama City and <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama Beach" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo´s </a>best kept secret. It isn´t the white super duper white type, but a natural tan color (that doesn´t kill your eyes with the sun´s reflection) and lots of personality. In its old days, the Club Santo Domingo used to be where the current basketball (and everything ball) courtyard is, and even had a pier for small cayuco boats that served local fishermen. The endless rock carpet is home for clams and other molluscs.  On low tide, the beach strip is a great place to hang out, and (as you can see) it gets &#8220;crowded&#8221; on Sundays when the local beisball or volleyball team is playing.</p>
<p>The only drawback: the water is contaminated as the sewer system empties directly into the ocean, as many old cities did back in the days. However, with the <a title="Cinta Costera Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,f7c7d329-0c33-4050-b0fc-7584a3a4f772.aspx" target="_blank">Cinta Costera </a>project (which has already started to put the pipes in) this problem will be corrected as it is redirecting everything to a treatment plan. Studies say that we´ll be able to wear our bikinis in less than 8 years.  Well, in fact, locals not only swim but surf at this beach, so I guess it can´t be that bad! I still wouldn´t recommend eating the clams and molluscs from here, though!</p>
<p>These are pictures from last Sunday, when the local beisball league played. While everybody in the city was trapped at home, in Casco you can walk out to the beach and enjoy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> Panama, <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo<br />

<p>Panama has been growing very fast for the last 8 years. A &#8220;miracle&#8221; made by a curious mix of tourism, investment and other countries misfortunes (Alias Venezuela and Chavez or Colombia and the FARC). Although on the short term there´s been a great impulse by the construction sector, consider Panama´s big three big long term fundamental investments: the Panama Canal Expansion project (which has already started), the relocation of the regional office of very important companies such as Caterpillar, Maersk, Dell, Procter and Gamble, Aventis and finally the oil refinary project in <a title="Puerto Armuelles" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,4910d046-61cb-4626-ba35-47db29cbfaab.aspx" target="_blank">Puerto Armuelles</a>. All of which has created a long term, sustained demand for talent and products, therefore growth.</p>
<p>But also inflation. The country has been experiencing for the first time ever what inflation is, and how to deal with a slowing global economy. One of its strenghts is that everything combined, Panama comes out as a micro niche within a niche, and that is where its advantage lies in today´s world.  Geographically and economically, this is where hurricanes are only felt as storms.</p>
<p>According to today´s La Prensa report (based on the report from the Government´s Comptroller office) Panama has grown this trimester 8.2% (see report here: http://www.contraloria.gob.pa/archivos_informesdelc/InformeTrimJunio2008/resumen.htm  and La Prensa note below). </p>
<p>Or the entire report here:  http://www.contraloria.gob.pa/archivos_informesdelc/InformeTrimJunio2008/index.htm</p>
<p>The basic numbers are:</p>
<p>Tourism grew 11% and spent 19% more<br />
Transportation, deposits and Communications grew 148.3% (wao, I guess Cable &amp; Wireless is really making some money)<br />
The Panama Canal increased income on 12.1%</p>
<p>Now, what about <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>? If Panama is where the hurricanes are only felt as storms, then in Casco all you need is a cute umbrella. The fundamentals of a revitalized, eclectic and economically vibrant historic city are as strong as ever. And since you never have millions of products available at one time (maybe 6 or 7) demand is always there. Plus, it is just a fun place to live in or visit, which at the end of the day brings more value on its own as humans rate fun highly in their scale. The most valuable places in the world are those where humans enjoy themselves the most. They have a rare combination of beauty and content, and Casco Antiguo is a rising star within Panama. </p>

<p class="texto">Eso representa una desaceleración de más de dos puntos porcentuales respecto a lo registrado en el mismo periodo de 2007, pero ese ritmo de crecimiento sigue siendo “muy fuerte” y uno de los más altos de la región. En eso coinciden el presidente del Colegio de Economistas, Raúl Moreira, y el financista Domingo Latorraca, analista de Deloitte.</p>
<p class="texto">La actividad económica del país se incrementó en 10.58% el año pasado. “La desaceleración que hemos tenido no es para alarmarse. Al contrario, si seguíamos creciendo a ese ritmo podíamos enfrentar un sobrecalentamiento de la economía y eso se traduciría en más inflación”, opina el economista Adolfo Quintero.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:x-small;">Panama, Casco Viejo</p>
<p>Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>

<p>A few days ago I got an email from a journalist at The Guardian, as they´ve found somehow my postings on <a title="La Casona" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,7b8f2a9c-9954-4a44-b075-905fa946a70e.aspx" target="_blank">La Casona </a>in Casco Viejo. It was quite exciting, this is my first collaboration with international press! Here is the article:</p>
<p><font size="2"> </p>
<p></font></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/aug/23/panama.southamerica"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-size:x-small;color:#0000ff;">http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/aug/23/panama.southamerica</span></span></a><span style="font-size:x-small;">Hats off to Panama</p>
<p>Panama City used to be somewhere people travelled through, not to. But the transformation of a run-down neighbourhood into one of the hippest barrios in Latin America is changing that Vicky Baker Saturday August 23 2008 The Guardian</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A grubby billboard stands propped up against the kerb.</p>
<p>&#8220;La Casona de las Brujas&#8221;, it reads, which loosely translates as the House of Witches.</p>
<p>It seems appropriate for a dark side street in Panama City&#8217;s ramshackle <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>neighbourhood. I have no idea where Xili, my Panamanian friend, is taking me, but I&#8217;m pretty sure she doesn&#8217;t have a secret penchant for black magic.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, it becomes clear. Some sort of magic has been worked here, but it&#8217;s far from sinister. What was once a <a title="Casona antes" href="http://panamacascoviejo.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/panama-events-la-casona-says-goodbye-and-welcome/" target="_blank">Catholic girls&#8217; school </a>has been transformed into one of the funkiest live music venues in the city. A shabby corridor leads to an open-air courtyard decked in fairy lights: the school&#8217;s old wooden desks have been brightly painted, barrels have been upturned to make seats, and there&#8217;s a giant portrait of the Virgin Mary keeping watch over the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Panama does not spring to mind as a place to find decent alternative music, but it&#8217;s fast gaining that reputation. Places such as La Casona &#8211; hosting a diverse bill of artists, national and international, signed and unsigned &#8211; are gaining huge fan bases and confounding preconceptions.</p>
<p>Until recently, the Panamanian capital was a place where travellers stopped only long enough to take a photo of the canal and do a bit of shopping, before moving on to the San Blas islands or the country&#8217;s other famous archipelago, Bocas del Toro, near the Costa Rican border.</p>
<p>But more and more people are now using the capital as a base. As well as its nightlife and booming restaurant scene, you&#8217;ve also got a wealth of attractions within easy reach, including two coastlines and the breathtaking rainforest with toucans, hummingbirds, harpy eagles, howler monkeys, even the occasional jaguar if you&#8217;re very lucky.</p>
<p>The place that has really got people talking is <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>(also known as Casco Antiguo). Until very recently it was a slum, but now this edgy district in the west of the city is the place to be seen. A low-rise maze of winding streets filled with colonial architecture, it is at that intriguing stage where a Wifi-enabled cafe with immaculately groomed window boxes sits next to an abandoned shell of a building with no windows.</p>
<p>It is also where the best nightlife is found. Bypass Calle Uruguay, a neon-lit central avenue lined with mainstream bars, restaurants and clubs, and head for La Casona de las Brujas (enlacasona.com).</p>
<p>At the forefront of the area&#8217;s artistic renaissance, the nomadic La Casona makes its home in rundown colonial properties before the developers move in. After a successful stint in the school, it&#8217;s about to unveil its latest location: an <a title="Citi Bank" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/citibak.aspx" target="_blank">art deco bank </a>with a high ceiling and the look of a hip loft apartment, just across the road from the school at <a title="Boyaca, Plaza Herrera" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/boyaca.aspx" target="_blank">Plaza Herrera</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s talking about the property boom here, but the country&#8217;s music is equally explosive,&#8221; says Fred Maduro, lead singer of the Vox, a metal and prog rock band that I see play at La Casona. &#8220;There&#8217;s huge diversity here &#8211; bands are fusing native music with rock, creating a really fresh sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems the region at large is finally taking note of the country&#8217;s talent too. Last November, a homegrown band, Los Rabanes, won a best album award at the Latin Grammys with their mix of ska, punk, reggae and rock.</p>
<p>The jazz scene is also attracting attention. If you miss the huge January festival, try Platea (scenaplatea.com) in Casco Viejo, a cosy joint with bare-brick walls that alternates live jazz nights with salsa. &#8220;James Bond was here recently,&#8221; the barman tells me proudly. Daniel Craig was in town shooting the latest 007 film, Quantum of Solace, with Panama standing in for Bolivia and Haiti.</p>
<p>For something grittier, Fridays and Saturdays bring heavy rock to <a title="My comments" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,69a87252-8215-4762-a146-2bd823cd68e1.aspx" target="_blank">Banos Publicos (Plaza Herrera</a>), which, as the name suggests, was once a public toilet. Behind sliding grill doors is a venue little bigger than a garage, painted black and decorated with glinting CDs hanging from the ceiling. The lack of frills makes you feel as if you&#8217;ve gatecrashed a squat party. &#8220;Make sure you pay for your beers. They sometimes forget to charge,&#8221; is the advice from the receptionist at my hostel, Luna&#8217;s Castle (hosteltrail.com/lunascastle, $10pp pn).</p>
<p>Panama City&#8217;s nightlife is enough to make a person nocturnal. But sleep through the day and you miss Panama&#8217;s other big draw: the beaches.</p>
<p>Here not only are you faced with the usual dilemma of which bathing suit to pack to the beach, you also have to pick a coast, Pacific or Caribbean. I consider tossing a coin, but I decide to opt for the one that&#8217;s been recommended by a local. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a Caribbean island . . .&#8221; she begins, and I am sold.</p>
<p>I board a diablo rojo, or &#8220;red devil&#8221;, as these ubiquitous converted American school buses are known in Panama. Resembling drive-by art shows, each one is covered roof-to-bumper in graffiti. (Think macho caricatures of Tupac and Beanie Man mixed, oddly, with cartoon characters and fairytale castles.) I make a brief stop at Portobelo &#8211; once a major hub for trading gold, now a likeable town, with a Unesco-listed ruined fortress and a forthcoming role in the Bond flick. Then, it&#8217;s just a short hop to the shores of Isla Grande.</p>
<p>Despite the name, Isla Grande isn&#8217;t that big &#8211; just 5km by 1.5km, with a population of around 200 people of African descent, most of whom live in colourful, low-rise buildings on the strip surrounding the main landing dock. Homely restaurants, bars and posadas dot the coast, while a winding path through a forest filled with coconut palms, banana trees and fist-sized butterflies brings you to the more isolated northern shore and the small, luxurious Bananas Village Resort (bananasresort.com, from $109pp pn).</p>
<p>I arrive on a weekday, so there are no crowds of daytripping urbanites. A two-minute walk from the dock takes me to a peninsula of empty sand, with shallow waters that are a tie-dye spectrum of blues.</p>
<p>Isla Grande may not have the remote isolation or indigenous tribes of the San Blas archipelago, a 50-minute flight (or three-hour jeep and boat ride) to the northeast of Panama City. But it has got the clear-watered beaches, and a laidback vibe. &#8220;Check out: 2pm,&#8221; reads the sign outside the waterside posada Caba&amp;ntilde;as Cholita, home to colourful mosaic-covered walls and quirky lobster decorations.</p>
<p>Activities on the island include snorkelling (keeping an eye out for Francis Drake&#8217;s lost coffin, rumoured to be lying somewhere in these waters), rambling to the central lighthouse, or taking a boat trip round the mangroves.</p>
<p>But, in keeping with the spirit of the island, I do none of the above. Just lying on the sand and splashing about a bit suits me fine. Besides, there&#8217;s lots of eating to do: cerviche, chichemie (a corn drink that resembles cold rice pudding) and cheesecake at a thatched cafe called El Nido del Postre (overpriced and not very Panamanian, but irresistible nonetheless).</p>
<p>One thing I can&#8217;t miss, however, is the famed Black Christ statue, revered by islanders and displayed just off shore. On October 21, the Black Christ festival sees Portobelo and its environs inundated with thousands of pilgrims. Some walk the entire 58 miles from the capital, crawling the last mile on their hands and knees. Although, being Latin America, the reverence is combined with a carnival atmosphere and lots of dancing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to picture this low-key idyll swarming with people. My stay on Isla Grande is peaceful and brief. But as tempted as I am to stick around, the pull of the city is just as strong. Besides, another trip may already be on the agenda. Rumour has it the Mexican reggae roots singer I saw at La Casona has a gig at the weekend. Not on a Caribbean island or the Pacific coast, and not in the hip capital city, but in the middle of the rainforest.</p>
<p>Hotel Travel (0871 230 8512, statravel.co.uk) has flights from Heathrow to Panama City for &amp;pound;598 rtn, inc tax. Stay at the chic Canal House (00507 228-1907, <a title="Canal House Panama Casco Viejo" href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/" target="_blank">canalhousepanama.com</a>) in Casco Viejo, from US$155 per room.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8216;I don&#8217;t get to travel as much as I&#8217;d like,&#8221; says Xili, my guide in Panama City. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I love meeting couchsurfers. I feel like I&#8217;m travelling with them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Born in Nicaragua but having spent 14 of her 26 years in Panama, she discovered </span><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=cb3bfb10-d672-4865-b80f-aba79c8bda26&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.couchsurfing.com%2f"><span lang="EN-US">couchsurfing.com</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> just three months ago, becoming an instant convert to the concept of volunteering to host passing travellers. Although she can&#8217;t follow the literal interpretation of having people sleeping on her couch (&#8220;My roommate doesn&#8217;t understand&#8221;), she is happy to show just about anyone around the country&#8217;s booming capital. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Panama City</span><span lang="EN-US"> has been nicknamed the &#8220;Miami of the south&#8221; and the parallels are as glaring as the sunlight: waterside skyscrapers, palm-lined avenues, multicultural cuisine, mind-boggling commercialism . . . but it was the tales of its pulsating nightlife that caught my attention. My travel-networking experiment across Central and South America got off to a great start in Ecuador, but I&#8217;ve yet to arrange a big night with a local.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If anyone was up for taking things up a notch, it was Xili (pictured above, right), a hardworking, hard-playing lawyer. With her couchsurfing profile listing music, partying and dancing among her interests, I was sure she could show me a good time. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re not planning to sleep tonight,&#8221; she says with a grin, as we come face to face for the first time, having exchanged a series of emails. We&#8217;ve arranged to meet in Casco Viejo, the city&#8217;s most up-and-coming neighbourhood, where derelict colonial buildings are slowly being renovated and a creative undercurrent is bubbling. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">What follows is an all-night tour of her favourite night spots. We start with Casco Viejo&#8217;s <strong>La Casona</strong><strong> de las Brujas</strong> (</span><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=cb3bfb10-d672-4865-b80f-aba79c8bda26&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.enlacasona.com%2f"><span lang="EN-US">enlacasona.com</span></a><span lang="EN-US">, a live music venue with an open-air courtyard decked in fairylights) and <strong>Baños Publicos</strong> (Plaza Herrera&#8217;s former public bathroom now hosting alternative rock bands). Then, in the early hours, we move on to the bright lights of Calle Uruguay, where minimalist <strong>S6IS</strong> satisfies Xili&#8217;s craving for reggaeton, and the more mainstream rock venue <strong>Sahara</strong> fits the bill when she has a sudden &#8220;need for David Bowie&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Would I have found these places alone? Maybe. In such a short time frame? Unlikely. Xili&#8217;s tour is the equivalent of a shot glass of pure liquor &#8211; it provides an instant hit of Panamanian nightlife, while the warm welcome from all her friends makes me feel right at home. </span></p>

We start with Casco Viejo&#8217;s <strong>La Casona</strong><strong> de las Brujas</strong> (</span><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=cb3bfb10-d672-4865-b80f-aba79c8bda26&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.enlacasona.com%2f"><span lang="EN-US">enlacasona.com</span></a><span lang="EN-US">, a live music venue with an open-air courtyard decked in fairylights) and <strong>Baños Publicos</strong> (Plaza Herrera&#8217;s former public bathroom now hosting alternative rock bands). Then, in the early hours, we move on to the bright lights of Calle Uruguay, where minimalist <strong>S6IS</strong> satisfies Xili&#8217;s craving for reggaeton, and the more mainstream rock venue <strong>Sahara</strong> fits the bill when she has a sudden &#8220;need for David Bowie&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Would I have found these places alone? Maybe. In such a short time frame? Unlikely. Xili&#8217;s tour is the equivalent of a shot glass of pure liquor &#8211; it provides an instant hit of Panamanian nightlife, while the warm welcome from all her friends makes me feel right at home. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">As for the nightlife itself, Calle Uruguay may be the country&#8217;s much-hyped nightlife avenue, but, for me, it&#8217;s the Casco Viejo venues &#8211; less commercial, more bohemian &#8211; that leave a lasting impression. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Getting back to my hostel just before dawn, an 8am start the next day is far from ideal, but I have prearranged a meet with my second Panama City contact, Gabriel from </span><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=cb3bfb10-d672-4865-b80f-aba79c8bda26&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.asmallworld.net%2f"><span lang="EN-US">asmallworld.net</span></a><span lang="EN-US">).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">ASW is one of a handful of invite-only travel networking sites (see also yacht6.com). How do you gain access to such a hallowed portal? Try asking around. A vague acquaintance &#8211; a self-confessed social-networking addict &#8211; helped get me through the door. (Although, if I fail to resist temptation to spam fellow members James Blunt and Naomi Campbell, I&#8217;ll be out.)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">ASW is undeniably elitist, nicknamed Snobster in reference to early social networking site Friendster. However, in my limited use, I&#8217;ve always met exceptions to the rule. Gabriel &#8211; a thirtysomething owner of an office supplies company and yoga teacher &#8211; is such an example: clearly well off, but down-to-earth, unassuming and very generous in his offer to let me join his out-of-town kitesurfing excursion.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Gabriel and friends spend every weekend camping out at Punta Chame, a little-known beach an hour and a half&#8217;s drive from the city. &#8220;You just arrived in Panama and you&#8217;re already at Punta Chame?&#8221; asks Amit, a fellow ASW member and kitesurfing addict, as I dip my toes in the Pacific for the first time. &#8220;You&#8217;ve certainly started at the top.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Jutting out on a peninsula, a clear day here offers views of the city and, when the tide is out, I have its expansive sands almost to myself, watching the kitesurfers crisscross the gentle waves. Later, as the wind subsides, we convene in the beach&#8217;s only restaurant to refuel on fresh fish and patacones (thick slices of plantain, squashed and fried).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The surfers are a sociable bunch and I find myself leaving the beach with a collection of phone numbers. After just one week, I feel like I&#8217;ve already begun to establish a small social circle through Gabriel and Xili (who I see many more times). After receiving invites to group dinners, house parties, karaoke nights and even a gig in a rainforest, I become even more convinced that travel networking is the way forward.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I&#8217;m starting to feel Panama will be tough to leave, but, fortunately, I have one more week. Next up I&#8217;m planning to see the less glamorous side of the country in Colon with Xili, and meet Toyo, a travel-networking member of the Kuna tribe. &#8220;Amiga!&#8221; he writes, when I tell him I&#8217;m in the country. &#8220;Welcome to my home. See you next week.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Travel networking etiquette</span></h2>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Keep it personal</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Contacting someone saying simply &#8220;Hello. Can I stay at your house for a week?&#8221; is unlikely to elicit a positive response. Introduce yourself and your plans. Where possible make the person feel you&#8217;ve chosen them for<br />
a reason. </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Always reply</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If you request to meet someone and they send a personal response to<br />
say they won&#8217;t be able to make it, return the courtesy with a reply rather than just moving straight on to the next person. </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Communicate</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Keep to your plans. Don&#8217;t leave your host waiting for you. Don&#8217;t pull out at the last minute. </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Give a little</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If you&#8217;re staying at someone&#8217;s house, bring a gift (maybe something typical from your own country). If they&#8217;re showing you around town, buy lunch or drinks if you can, and always pay your way. </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Be courteous</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If staying at someone&#8217;s home, do not use it as a base to party with other people. Fit in with host&#8217;s schedule. Don&#8217;t sleep in for hours. Don&#8217;t overstay your welcome.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Socialise</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Make sure you spend time getting to know your host. If you&#8217;re just after free accommodation or a tour guide, you&#8217;ve got the wrong idea. </span></p>

Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>
<p><br />
Panama´s Fish Market rocks.  It is at the very entrance of <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, just off Avenida Balboa. A white and light blue building with the Japanese flag and the Panamanian flag on the top of the building (the new fish market installations where a donation of the Japanese government). As you approach, the characteristic smell of fresh fish will hit you: don´t get discouraged. Block your nose, get in and run for the stairs into their restaurant. Or, for those who actually enjoy the distinctive smell, you can wander around and buy whatever you want, as the restaurant will cook it for you. The largest, best meals I´ve had in Panama has been with groups of friends and tons and tons of food from the downstairs fisheries. It is amazing all the stuff that can come out of one beautiful piece!</p>
<p>If you choose to go straight for the stairs, your menu options are very good as well. This particular restaurant has peruvian style food and they are proud of it, as they have already won some awards from the Peruvian Embassy.  We asked for a peruvian style lenguado ceviche (which is spicier than the normal one) and when the waiter brought it he said smiling: Who asked for the best ceviche in the world? I don´t know if it actually is, but is pretty good!</p>
<p>My other favorite there is the jalea. Fried dices of fish (they also do the jalea mixta which includes octopus and other seafood) surrounded with &#8220;pico de gallo&#8221; (chopped tomatoes, onions and herbs). They serve it with patacones (fried plantains) or yuca. The plate can serve for two or if you use it as entree everybody can take a bit. The picante sause (aji chombo) is really hot, use it carefully unless you are a professional.</p>
<p>Highly recommended: order your beer first. They have really cold beer, and you´ll love it. Order at least two rounds, as the one thing this place lacks is service speed. But if you are already into your second beer round, probably you won´t mind as much!</p>
<p>The fish market is one of the most authentic culinary experiences I know in <a title="Map Panama City and Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-casco.aspx" target="_blank">Panama City</a>. If you like fish, spice and authenticity&#8230; this is your next hangout!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> Panama, <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>,<br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>
<p>I was at my office, trying to start my Monday as usual, when a huge crowd of kids came running and screaming&#8230; &#8220;Saladino! Saladino! Canguro! Canguro!&#8221;.  The crowd jumped away, singing and screaming Irving´s Saladino´s name. I suddenly realized, our Panamanian Kangaroo was supposed to jump this morning. I open the internet, and there it is!! he just won gold with an 8.34mt2 jump.</p>
<p>For most countries used to sending people to these competitions it is a good thing, but most of their habitants don´t think too much about it. I´m sure in the US people are very proud of Phelps and other athletes, and they should. I saw a picture of their leading female swimmer and I was truly intimidated by the powerful figure and sharp performance. But, even if things are never easy and I´m sure they spend a lot of time looking for economic support, truth is, they probably have 90% more support there and better trainning and equipment than we have ever had here.</p>
<p>And still Panama has produced some great sport figures such as Duran (the most famous at this point), the Valdes brothers, and Mariano Rivera. But whenever the Olympics came, the delegation was very thin. The athletes didn´t have (and still don´t) any money to get their trainners there, they had to get everything by themselves, usually their equipment was (and is) very old and worst of all (our esgrima girl almost couldn´t compete because her sword was too old and rusty. She had to buy one there), the funds from the institute of sports where to finance the trip of a bunch of bureocrats that had nothing to do and didn´t really care for the athletes themselves.</p>
<p>But perseverance is an incredible thing! This year, all of our athletes, despite their bad equipment, half trainning, lost baggage, no money, last minute scandals, all of them not only surpassed their personal marks, but managed to get re classified into better positions. But the big cherry on the pie was Irving Saladino, a talented guy from one of the poorest parts of Panama, Colon.  This province is the craddle of most of our athletes and sport figures. Knowing Colonenses (my best friend is from this province) this week will be a huge festivity. Irving got the first gold medal ever in an Olympic game for Panama by jumping the lenght of my office.</p>
<p>I´m sure tomorrow´s paper will have a wonderful big size poster of him at the front page and suddenly everyone will run to hug and kiss him. But this was not done in a day, so my respects go not only to himself but to his parents who supported him all the way and probably paid or raised funds for him. To all the athletes that managed to even get there in a display of perseverance and discipline. Congratulations!!!!</p>
<p>I hope the next one comes from <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>. They are surely practicing jumps right now!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Today is &#8220;Sábado de carnaval&#8221;, everyone is out either at the beach or at one of Panama´s countryside towns to celebrate. Casco gets pretty quiet, but if you walk to Central Avenue, you´ll see everyone buzzing, buying lottery tickets, hats, wigs and food, getting ready for the weekend and the parades.  Salsipuedes also has a traditional sale of school books, as the school calendar starts right after carnivals. We prefer to avoid the big party at Cinta Costera, if you are in Panama city, do explore Central Avenue or head to the beaches, specially Taboga or anywhere in the Pearl Islands.  Traffic to the countryside might be a challenge! if you do go that way, make sure to pack your patience!</p>

<p>Last night was the second edition of Cine Animal at Temporal, Casco Viejo. The star film of the night was Cucarachita Mandi, a twist on the Panamanian fable &#8220;La Cucarachita Mandinga&#8221;.  All the films, including Mandi, were based on animation. Temporal also showed what it takes to make it: all the props (which were for sale) and the amazing number of people involved to do it. My favorite voice character was by Jaguar Clandestino, one of the really talented slam poets in Panama.  He raps pretty well too!</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Temporal team and to Valerie for keeping it up! last night was super fun!</p>

<p>To dance, is one thing. To create, another.  To direct your own peers takes a special skill. Now try to do all of it, and, by the way, you are barely a teenager.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we went to Enlaces dance program, to see the first choreography fully created, directed and danced by the students. Several pieces woven into one concept: what it is to be born in a place/circumstance vs another.  The result was fantastic, in a world where it seems we don´t find the correct words to talk about our difference, these kids found it almost easy to show us with simple honesty how they see it and feel it through movement.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the whole Enlaces team, and above all kudos to the young choreographers and dancers! sorry for my amateur video, hope you like them.

<p>Last Wednesday, young families in Casco gathered at 5th street to inaugurate Casco´s first &#8220;baby park&#8221;, fully created and implemented by the community. The ngo that made it happen was AVACA, Casco´s neighborhood association.  The event was honored by the presence of the Major and the Director of Historic Patrimony, who have been known for working for a greener and friendlier city.  The park is free and fully open to the public.</p>
<p>They also celebrated the third year of Day at the Bay, an initiative to bring awareness to Casco´s beach as a natural resource for the city and a family space for the community.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone who participated! to learn more about  AVACA and their community work:   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/avacacasco/?ref=bookmarks">Facebook</a>   Website: <a href="http://www.avaca.org.pa/noticias">www.avaca.org.pa </a></p>

<p>A mini movie theatre in Casco Viejo!   Arte Nómada and Cine Animal  transformed La Vecindad in a pop up mini cinema. This week, they opened with three short films by Panamanian artists and the place was packed. The films had fashion as a common theme, but they were all very different: from sci fi to abstract.</p>
<p>Next week they´ll be doing &#8220;Neighborhood Film&#8221; night, so keep tuned!</p>

<p>The Caramelized Apples, brings me so many memories of my childhood.  I remember seeing them at fairs, at carnivals, it&#8217;s like turning the cassette around to see this image.  I was curious to know the origin of this wonderful dessert that made Eve sin and to Snow White fell into the temptation to give a bite and I found  that in 1908 William Kolb produced them in his store in New Jersey and in the &#8217;50s Dan Walker changes a Little the color´s formula to start being called apple with caramel.</p>
<p>This sweet enjoyed by generations, part of the childhood of many, has been lost by the big cities but here in Casco Antiguo you can still find it and watch the children have this pleasure.</p>

<p>All of a sudden&#8230; puf! we are in 2017!  as in many places around the World, Panama is full of traditions to ensure a great start for 2017. From saving the seeds in 12 grapes (counting them, and buying a lottery ticket with the number), to exploding a life size doll packed with &#8220;bombitas&#8221; (fireworks&#8230; for those who like extreme sports), my favorites are always around the colorful foods that are available only in December. Going to the beach also ranks pretty high.  There is an important exodus that happens that week to every single beach in Panama. But nothing like walking around Central Avenue right before new year´s holidays to check out the colorful bounty of fruits, roots, herbs, Jamaica flowers, resins, incenses, and good luck baths with strange names.  The best? a dense fruit cake from our Afroantillian side called &#8220;pan bom&#8221;.  Always wondered: I mean, it´s not like people can´t make it the rest of the year, right? why is it that I have to wait until December to get it?  Someone once told me why: it wouldn´t taste the same!!!! I guess I have to excercise my patience. 2017 resolution!</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed your New Year wherever you were and that 2017 brings above all things health!</p>

Calle 4ta is getting artsy! Galería Vida opened at Casa Mendez, next to Entre Pulgas. They have a lovely mix of latin american high end handcrafts, especially from Mexico and Guatemala. Laurie, the owner and Casco Viejo neighbor has years of experience in working with indigenous communities and helping them develop high quality product to help support their communities. Her good eye, style and sense of humor are all around Galeria Vida (which means Life Gallery).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Multiple websites and adds mention Panama as Paradise. Is it really? what about Casco Viejo?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#333333;font-family:Verdana;">Panama</span><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#333333;font-family:Verdana;">, <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a><br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#333333;font-family:Verdana;">Yesterday I read an article about Panama and foreigners living and doing business here. It was a positive article with the experience of some foreigners who have made their lives and businesses in Panama work. As usual, the posts below showed a wide range of comments, but there was one that got my attention: a disappointed person remarked that <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama </a>was not paradise and it had a list of all things he didn´t like. In my job as a real estate agent there is one and only one thing I am absolutely certain: expectations play a huge roll in the level of satisfaction of the client. This can certainly be applied to all aspects of our lives, as humans are constantly out looking for &#8220;paradise&#8221; in every little corner.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#333333;font-family:Verdana;">Now, the trick with this &#8220;paradise&#8221; problem is multiple. Notice I say &#8220;trick&#8221; because it is a trick. We trick ourselves into believing a place or a thing is &#8220;paradise&#8221;, and marketing specialists know this (as they are humans too) and use this tendency to make us fantasize and to get us to buy stuff. We, as clients know it, but we still fall for it. That´s the game, and I get the sense we like it.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#333333;font-family:Verdana;">But Paradise is a deceiving thing on both sides of the road. To begin with, Paradise means a lot of radically different things to a lot of people. In my closest dictionary, Paradise is a state of supreme happiness, bliss. It is also a place of extreme beauty, delight, or happiness. All of it, we know, lies in the eye of the beholder, which at the same time is pumped up or not by expectations. Not even religion can get it together on what is or should be Paradise. Somehow, people got it into their minds it was white beach and a sunny sky. That means tan beach ain´t paradise? I like tan beach. I like it more than white, frankly. And I like clouds, it is less hot and I feel less dehydrated. And rain is quite romantic.</p>
<p>Truth is that we have allowed ourselves to get wired in a way that paradise is a package of very defined things (which anyways change from culture to culture and from people to people) and when it doesn’t look, feel or taste like the magazine cover of our preference, then there is a problem. But the trick is that we know, as we also know models in magazines aren´t as beautiful when met in person(they do have skin marks, they are very skinny and some even have bad hair&#8230; but great bones!), that paradise simply doesn´t exist as perfection doesn´t exist. Like believing the woman (or man) we are marrying is &#8220;perfect&#8221; and then divorcing her (or him) on the grounds that you just &#8220;found out&#8221; he or she wasn´t. Hello???? It is all a fantasy to make us escape our reality for a while. But read it again: Paradise doesn´t exist. Reality, on the other hand, will lead you to long lasting, satisfying relationships.</p>
<p>Now, is Panama Paradise? Of course not! And you wouldn´t be able to name one country where Paradise actually is. As usual, the media creates the &#8220;hipe&#8221; by using those words to the point where they loose all meaning. In the past, words tended to be these valuable vehicles to convey important concepts that had some weight. When you gave your word it meant the world. No papers needed to be signed. With the extreme use of faaaabulous, wooonderful, paradise, fantastic, etc we have lost track of what they mean. Faabulous is the new pink or vanilla. And it is a shame, because some things are trully amazing, wonderful and fantastic or beautiful. But used without discretion just to overcome the &#8220;marketing noise&#8221; out there to get your product across it looses its own value and by the way hurts the same product you wanted to highlight.</p>
<p>We should start downsizing, even in our everyday conversations. Don´t mind the financial bubble, there is a language bubble crisis in modern society that is getting to affect our judgement about the world and is numbing us to the real great things that life and countries have to offer us. We should make a vow never to use the word &#8220;paradise&#8221; and use words like great, nice and enjoyable when there is really a cause for it.</p>
<p>Why? because this is the only way everyone wins. Think about it: if you scream &#8220;paradise&#8221; and someone buys on it, when they get there and it happens it rains too much, traffic is loud, it is too hot or any other thing, then both client and marketer end up in a bad spot. But if your speech is truthful and moderate, and it sets the right expectations, when the person buys he is satisfied and both parties end up in the right place.</p>
<p>For many years, we´ve had this notion that Caribbean countries (and make no mistake, Panama is a Caribbean country, I still don´t know why we are still in the Central America section) are paradise. White beaches, laid back population, a coconut and a palm. The hammock and piña colada life. But reality, as all realities, is made of different angles and the &#8220;simple life&#8221; is far from simple. Caribbean countries have wonderful beaches, most likely full of sand fleas, mosquitoes, etc. Nature is great until you get bit by something you can´t even pronounce. People are laid back, which means a heavy lazy vein is also present. They are happy people and love to party, I guess that is fine. But partying has it´s own set of negative things, as many would know very well. For every good thing there is a bad one, as every coin has two sides, and ignoring it is trying to cover the sun with the finger.</p>
<p>Everything is cheaper in Caribbean countries, Panama included, and I agree the country has streched this card too far, along with the tax heaven thing (you see! another concept of Paradise!). But expecting exactly the same service at the same level as you where at home but for half the price in a completely different culture is unrealistic. Basic economics tell you that if it is half the price is because there are hidden costs, and it is normal that there would be. Hidden costs are usually charged under the currency of time (things take longer to get done), effort (we are laid back, remember?) and cultural differences among other things.</p>
<p>Rabindranath Tagore once said: &#8220;If you cry for loosing the sun, your tears will prevent you from looking at the stars&#8221;. Panama isn´t paradise, but it is a great place to travel, live and invest in. It is a place on Earth, not on Heaven (wherever that is in your specific culture and religion). If you are setting up a business, you do have far less competition. It is hard work, don´t fool yourself. But you have the opportunity to do things and be an entrepreneur in ways that maybe your country wouldn´t allow for it anymore as it is so crowded and expensive. Panama may not have super white sand beaches everywhere and at the snaps of your fingers, but it does have two interesting coasts with wild geographies worth exploring. And if white sand is what you need, go to San Blas, Bocas or Pearl Islands, you´ll find it there along with Kuna Indians, afroantillian culture or a mix of both with a third party.</p>
<p>Not all Panamanians speak English, but Panama´s incredible diversity for the small country it is makes for an intriguing palette to explore, and even surprising that they all speak Spanish. Seven different indian tribes, a mix of Spanish, afroantillian, african, white, chinese, you name it! Service isn´t probably at the top level, but the country is learning fast. It is one of the easiest countries to travel to and to do tourism, as everything is so close. You can plan for beach, mountain and ethnic in a less than a week vacation or just relax on a fishing trip at really beautiful sites.</p>
<p>For a scientist, diversity is paradise. If so, then Panama is paradise. The one other strenght it has other than geographic location is diversity. In every aspect. Panama has a little bit of everything, and for those adventurous sould who enjoy exploring a petit store of curiosities, Panama is a good fit.</p>
<p>Since I have dedicated my life to a very specific part of Panama, <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, I should make a disclaimer right away: Casco Viejo is not paradise. It is a 300 year old colonial site, where everything is mixed. From architecture (art deco side by side with caribbean, colonial, french, republican among others) to social (poor, middle class and rich), to lifestyles and ways of thinking. Restored and unrestored, ruins side by side with sites under construction.</p>
<p>Casco Viejo is the most down to earth community I know and that is where the true beauty lies. It is not fabulous in a &#8220;dinner topic&#8221; manner, but it is highly unusual and very special because it is so rare and somehow for those who get it, there is a profound visceral connection, no words needed. Here people care about people and the ones who have moved here and / or invested here enjoy building a community for others. This, in combination with the beautiful site itself, makes for the best you can hope for anywhere whether it is back home or not.</p>
<div><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#333333;font-family:Verdana;">This morning, I woke up with a thought. I understand the deep need for people to constantly be looking for paradise and happiness. Aristoteles said that was mankind´s only mission, and certainly mine. But the truth is that if anywhere, paradise is within ourselves. Once we know that, then the world is our playground and is important to see things for what they are, not judge them on how the magazine cover looks like. Those are made to shine on our faces and trigger &#8220;buy, buy, buy&#8221; instinct. Be curious, don´t expect anything. This is not only with Panama, this applies everywhere. With open eyes, you´ll be able to enjoy both the sun and the everlasting beauty of a night full of stars.</span></div>

		<description><![CDATA[Panama isn´t regarded as a high- tech country, and if you ask anyone (inside or outside Panama) on how techy our government is they would probably give you a blank look. But something is changing radically from inside out. Senacyt, City of Knowledge and even COPA are making some huge steps forward. Check it out here!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> Panama, <a title="Panama Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a><br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>
<p>Before I worked at the <a title="STRI" href="http://www.stri.org/" target="_blank">Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute </a>I spent a year (or two?) at <a title="Senacyt" href="http://www.senacyt.gob.pa/" target="_blank">Senacyt </a>which is Panama´s version of a Ministry of Technology. While working at their Public Relations department, I had a global overview of the institution´s programs, which always amazed me. Panama isn´t regarded as a high- tech country, and if you ask anyone (inside or outside Panama) on how techy our government is they would probably give you a blank look.</p>
<p>But Senacyt (Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología) was already administrating incredible programs, providing internet in schools for places as remote as Darien or running DNA laboratories and setting up programs to involve schools on science and innovation. And so much more and bizarre I couldn´t even start to figure it out. But I have to admit, they don´t really reach out to the media, I guess the usual lack of funds.</p>
<p>However, (and knowing the usual lack of funds issue it amazed me) I opened today´s newspaper (La Prensa, page 47A) and there it was, they are launching their 4th Technology and Innovation Awards with an amazing budget of 8 million dollars to distribute between the winners. Wao. For Panama that is a huge and radical step forward and an enormous effort to close the technology gap. Something is really changing from inside out. The categories involve: business innovation, research and development, science against poverty, incentives to sciente and technology activiites and new initiatives from the tech data base Panama Resuelve.</p>
<p>According to the note, since 2005 they have already implemented 14.1 million dollars on diferent projects, but what they are looking for is to increase Panama´s competitivity through science and (more importantly) innovation. And just to sweeten the deal, the category with the biggest award is business innovation with a top award of $200,000 financed by the World Bank.</p>
<p>Between Senacyt and the City of Knowledge, a recently approved e commerce law and an increasing government effort to digitalize their procedures Panama is on the right track.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with Casco Viejo? absolutely nothing. Although they are located 15 minutes away!</p>
<p>By the way and speaking of technology, <a title="copa" href="http://www.stri.org/" target="_blank">COPA </a> (Panama´s main international airline) also maid an announcement today. They inaugurated their first plane simulator. Aparently it is the first equipment of this sort in Latin America and it simulates the brazilian Embraer 190 airplane. It is also located in <a title="City of Knowledge" href="http://www.cdspanama.org/" target="_blank">City of Knowledge.<br />
</a><br />
This simulator has been designed to run at least 7000 flight hours and will be a valuable trainning resource, especially for local pilots which had to travel to Canada to get proper trainning. By installing this simulator, now COPA will be a trainning Hub for the region. Already Mexico will start to bring pilots and so is Ecuador.  The Embraer 190 is COPA´s second simulator. The first one is the Boeing 737.</p>
<p>All this 15 minutes away from a 300 year old city. Isn´t it a crazy world?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Dozens of years ago, the neighborhood of Casco Viejo was almost in ruins. With tens of years in abandon and a good part of its population living in forgotten houses, Casco Viejo started to receive brushes of decorum in the middle of the 80´s, when the government started rehabilitating some of the plazas, buildings and churches. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">During the sociopolitical crisis of 1985-1989, the neighborhood was left aside and the panorama didn’t change until 1997 when a special incentive law was approved to restore the properties. Finally, in 1998 UNESCO declared the site World Heritage Site. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">What has been done, what is still pending</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">With a total of 865 properties, the current rhythm of restoration is good, according to the director of the Office of Casco Antiguo, Ariel Espino. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">However – and according to 2007 statistics – only 13% (114) properties have been restored, while the other 74% are public buildings without intervention, abandoned, empty lots or unrestored occupied houses. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">“The unrestored homes have a relation with the investment rhythm”, says Espino. It is also related with speculation which has affected the speed of restorations. Because as Patrizia Pinzón, sales manager of Arco Properties confirms, the “big illness” of Casco Viejo is speculation. “People that bought to restore, but they never did”, explains. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Nevertheless, the projects that have given a new face to Panama’s first neighborhood runs up to 13<sup>th</sup> Street. Government built social housing thrive the main development in this area. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Some of the rescued houses are the Boyacá, the Casa Rosada, San Felipe Neri and Elsa Salazar. In construction are Casa Amarilla, Casa Nueve and Casa Francia. The idea is to provide old residents and those who can pay and be responsible with an option in the neighborhood. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">And the fact is that, as Pinzón says, although at the beginning they tried to rescue and preserve only the architectural patrimony, it has also been important to protect it’s human patrimony. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">But for Heriberto Trejos from Fundación Calicanto there is still a need for the organizations working in different programs to coordinate efforts more consistently. “We are still in debt”, he says, especially with children. “They are lacking of options in fields like sports and arts, we have to follow up closely their family situation” he adds. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Hildegard Vásquez, restoration architect of Hache Uve S.A. thinks the same. “The idea is to start building a community where everyone wants to live”. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">On the infrastructure, there are still some streets to repair and burying the cables and sewer repairs are an ongoing project. The costs of this project will be known at the ends of this year, said Espino. Then they’ll need to find financing. </span></span></span></p>

Their model is to enter unrestored buildings and inject energy and creativity. Now, they have just moved to the former Citibank building, a wonderful piece of Art Deco in Plaza Herrera. ]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Panama, Casco Viejo<br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe<br />
</a><br />
While everybody is excited today about Beijing´s dramatic opening for the Olimpics (which, by the way, where simply amazing! wao), another bright sun shined this morning over the newspaper as they announced the bay cleaning project has been completed so far in 21%, with an investment of 35 million dollars so far. According to the note at La Prensa, they are currently working at the collectors at the main city rivers (Juan Díaz, Matías Hernandez, Rio Abajo, Monte Oscuro, Espavé and others). And the most exciting part is that they expect the project to be 90% completed by the ends of 2008, which would represent a total investment of $200 million dollars.</p>
<p>Why am I so excited? because we have waited almost 50 years for this to happen. Meaning, the city was never planned for its growth and now we finally had the good sense to fix the problem, plus create a nice park along the coast to cover all the pipes (<a title="Cinta Costera" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7z6cK_q5b8" target="_blank">Cinta Costera</a>). As I´ve posted before, this will change the city and especially Casco Viejo profoundly. Panamanians lost the habit of going to the beach right in front of the city because it was contaminated. If everything goes well, in less than 8 years, we´ll be able to run around in bikinis and sunbathe right outside our doors without having to go to the country side.</p>
<p>For Casco Viejo this is huge, as we already have<a title="Casco Viejo Santo Domingo Beach" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,370f0310-d724-42c4-9021-1122e3c3ebc4.aspx" target="_blank"> sand beach </a>and although locals anyways bathe here and even surf a small wave at the point of Las Bovedas, I wouldn´t call it exactly the cleanest thing you could ever do.  So there you go, even if the fireworks and amazing artists at the Olimpics in Beijing are today´s main event, I would say this one contributes more to my personal happiness and trully raises Panama´s lifestyle for the long term. <a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/peatonal-007.jpg"></a></p>

<h3>Samantas Story &#8211; Project Las Bovedas</h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Casco Viejo,  a surfer´s paradise?</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Project: Las Bovedas Surf Club</span><br />
By Miriam Butterman</div>
<p> <br />
Casco Viejo is in a constant state of change. Call it restoration or call it tourism, either way it is a transformation. In the process of translating this “Old City” into a new experience, there are long time residents who maintain their connections with small but significant corners of the old city, where old friendships die-hard, and where some faithful dwellers want nothing more than to share their familiarity with newcomers.</p>
<p>One such resident is a young national athlete, Enilda  “Samanta” Alonso. When Samanta was seven, she followed neighborhood kids to a small corner of the old city called “Las Bovedas” where land meets sea, and there she discovered the power of the wave.<br />
 <br />
A recent conversation with Samanta, and a stroll along Las Bovedas, brought light to the many layers of Casco Viejo, and a young womanâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s desire to see the Old City, its residents, and guests reunite with a very unique coastline.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Samantha´s Story: </span><br />
Samanta is now and always has been a resident of San Felipe&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> <a title="Panama, Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Panama, Casco Viejo<br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</a></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">While the Panama Canal Expansion has gotten all the national and international media attention, oil companies like Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Qatar Petroleum have entered almost through the back door, negotiating as quietly as possible a refinery hub in Puerto Armuelles at the frontier with Costa Rica.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although there is still very little known about the project, studies are on its way and according to calculations it aims to produce up to 350,000 barrels per day. This would allow Panama to become a regional hub for energy distribution, adding one “hub” more to a convenient collection that already includes air travel, cargo and ports. It is worth mentioning that this combination is what have made it possible for companies like Caterpillar, Hewlett Packard, Proctor and Gamble and even ST Aerospace to move their regional headquarters or open their maintenance centers in Panama, investing approximately 1.825 billion US Dollars according to the Ministry for Trade and Industries numbers for 2007 quoted in the last AMCHAM magazine. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to El Economista, the second phase studies should come out this year and the company is expected to begin operations at the beginnings of 2012.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Puerto Armuelles, as I remember it from short visits five years ago ( or more) is a quiet town, traditionally a banana producer and not really very active in any other aspect. This project will change everything for Puerto. New housing, new industry, new infrastructure. Not bad for a town where public schools are made out of wood and the first computer lab came in only eight years ago. On a global level, the investment alone will surpass the Canal Expansion itself, and with the current energy crisis it will probably mean an incredible advantage for Panama as a country. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a world where resources are scarce, Panama has unique advantages that allow you to weather the storm easier. Key and diverse geography, short distances within the country. Coast to coast in 2 hours or less if you are flying. Center to frontier in less than 7 hours driving or 1 hour flying. No hurricanes, no natural disasters. Only rain, sun and a 100% humidity half of the year. And, of course, there is <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>. Nothing like it in the country both as an investment or a home, and still almost half the price as any of its restored regional peers.  Add to it the increasing number of international commercial trade treaties, the Canal Expansion and now the oil refineries&#8230; where would you rather be?</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</a></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">A new business has opened in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>! It is called &#8220;Indigo&#8221;, an oriental-mediterranean fusion restaurant between 2nd and 3rd street in Central Avenue. Just by the side of the Tourism Police and next to the restaurant Manolo Caracol. They are still on their soft opening week, but Clara and I had the best passion fruit ceviche and some fantastic Greek empanadas with goat cheese and a sundried tomato sweet sauce. The ambiance is mostly Indian mixed with Moroccan, the decoration has lounge spaces to relax, and a bar area and more formal seating if you want to have dinner.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But the best spot is the back patio. Al fresco dinning with the possibility to extend into the Arco Chato ruins, as it has a door connecting the patio with the historical monument. They can arrange for dinners and small private events at the back of Arco Chato.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Talking to Fernando and Katherine, two of the owners of the restaurant, they tell us they can host seating dinners up to 75 people. Cocktails, they can manage so far about a 115. But being able to offer the charm of Arco Chato and the convenience of indoor seating for an event&#8230; priceless!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Contact them at: 228-1822  indigo@indigopanama.com</p>

<p>So few times we get to meet the faces behind the places. Daniel, Dan and David are the &#8220;3 amigos&#8221; from Luna´s Castle, <a title="Panama Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo´s </a>new youth hostal at the entrance of San Felipe. The hostal is located at the former Casa Ehrman at 9th Street. It has wonderful views to Panama´s Bay and the modern city skyline, but also the house, as it was never abandoned, is almost in its original form, giving a great sense of charm and history.</p>
<p>The house has a great patio surrounded by stone walls. An original stone vault is the perfect place for a bar, I think the guys are already setting it up!</p>
<p>How to contact them: 262 1540 / <a href="mailto:mondotaituhostel@yahoo.com">mondotaituhostel@yahoo.com</a>   If you are looking to visit several sites in Panama, they also own a couple of youth hostals in Bocas del Toro (Casa Heike and Mondo Taitu, for example).</p>

<p>I swear I had this great-very-serious article about the gas refinery projects that are coming to Panama, but someone just sent me this amazing picture and I just couldn´t help it. Check it out and you´ll see what I mean. Yes, again&#8230; it is my <a title="Casco Viejo, Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,96ae5d20-d88f-4255-bd17-3910b9a6a616.aspx" target="_blank">tomato fixation</a>. Someone suggested I needed to seek professional help. I´ve been searching in the web for help groups, but seem not to find any, so I´ll guess I´ll have to create a group by myself. I´m struggling here to find the right name&#8230;</p>
<p>But take a look at this picture and tell me it is not one of the most incredible things you´ve seen. I´m no scientist here, but from my work at Smithsonian I learned about survival techniques plants use to keep themselves into the gene pool and not die before they reproduce (which is also good for animals). But this is like a Bruce Willis &#8220;Die Hard&#8221; movie version! almost the Kama Sutra of tomatoes showing off an upside down pose! Think about it: this guy managed to # 1 germinate and develop from a dark hole in a brick wall (this is pretty awesome on itself) #2 gather strength to grow normally even if up side down and in lack on any real soil and # 3 bear tomatoes and therefore propagate as a species. Some charitative soul interested probably on eating the tomato put a little string so it wouldn´t fall on its own weight. However, I get the sense this guy is stronger than you might see at first glance. Can you imagine doing the same as a human? fat chance!</p>

The first step is to clearly identify your goals. Are you looking for a house for private use? A building to convert into a condo? Is commercial space important to you? Views? Parking? Each building has its own characteristics and, because of the historic preservation rules, your project’s features will be largely dictated by what currently exists on the property. You can obtain a copy of the historic preservation rules from Oficina del Casco Antiguo. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;margin:0 0 0 36pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span></p>

Soft costs can range from 15-30% of construction costs. Understanding this upfront will help you determine the size of the project you want to take on. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;margin:0 0 0 36pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span></p>

Because there is no comprehensive multiple listing system in Panama City, we recommend working with a licensed real estate <a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/properties.aspx" target="_blank">professional</a>. They typically have many more listings than they put on their websites and often have a walth of knowledge regarding attributes of specific buildings that may not be apparent from their fasades (e.g. views, internal courtyards, historical significance, future nearby projects, etc.) They also know which buildings are problematic. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;margin:0 0 0 36pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span></p>

An architect experienced in the Casco is essential for two reasons. First, historic building renovations are inherently tricky. They require very careful site analysis, knowledge of traditional building materials and the willingness to delve into a level of drafting detail that is unusual in new construction. They also require knowledge of the historic preservation laws in the Casco, and the procedures for getting projects through the approval process. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;margin:0 0 0 36pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span></p>

First, consult with Patrimonio Historico to determine exactly what historical preservation guidelines apply to that specific building. For instance, if you are told that the building has an opening for parking, confirm with Patrimonio Historico that it is so. Second, determine if the building is occupied and, if so, how many residents are in the building. Do not attempt to negotiate a desalojo using an attorney who does not have experience in the area. The attorneys who specialize in this type fo work know the neighborhood dynamics and how to approach the process. Using an inexperienced attorney will cost you time and money, and may have implications far beyond your project. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;margin:0 0 0 36pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;margin:0 0 0 36pt;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-US"><span><span style="font-size:small;">f)</span><span style="font-family:&quot;">        </span></span></span><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="color:#993300;">Settle on closing mechanisms</span><span lang="EN-US">. Once you have found a property you like, work with your attorney and broker to establish closing mechaniscs that fit your timetable and needs. Closings in Panama are typically much simpler affairs than in the US. They can be handled remotely through powers of attorney and wire transfers or lovally by a visit to the notary and a certified check. In all cases, a reputable attorney is a must. If you do no speak Spanish, find an English speaking attorney, but do not be mislead into believing that good language skills and slick marketing translate into good legal skills. Ask around, interview and get references. </span></span></span></p>

<p>The oldest inside joke in <a title="Panama Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>is that it isn´t a colonial city at all. As a matter of fact, all the examples of colonial buildings burnt during one of the three big fires back in the XVIII century. All but one: Casa Gongora. The only true colonial house of Casco Viejo. This is what I call an extreme makeover: before and after restoration.</p>
<p>Casa Gongora serves now as a museum, a concert hall, an art gallery. Located in Avenida Central and Fourth Street, right in front of my favorite ice cream shop GrandClement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Casco Antiguo, San Felipe<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Buying a restored apartment is one of the best investments you can make in <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/buying-historic.aspx" target="_self">Casco Viejo</a>. It is an almost risk free enterprise where your costs are known and very little variation occurs. Also, you can get it rented almost immediately and your big gain is in the appreciation, so you can legally &#8220;sit on it&#8221; forever. Plus, you can even finance it with a local bank.  Someone else carries the risk of building, financing, time, constructions, historical approvals&#8230; you just get the key, a title and all you have to do is to go to UNION Fenosa and connect the electricity. Well, perhaps to Idaan to get the water under your name and to Cable and Wireless to connect phone and internet (although other providers are already in town).  As complicated as this sounds, it is not even a third of the complications, the risks, the costs and the grey hair you get when restoring a building on your own.<br />
</span>However, there are a few things you should keep in mind, which tend to be different in Panama than in the States and in some parts of Europe. Please read below and take note&#8230;<span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">1. Finishes</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Traditionally in Panama it is common for apartments to be sold with minimal finishings. As the market has become more international, developers have started to raise finishing levels. Still, in many cases, appliances, light fixtures, air conditioners and other basic items are not included in the price of new apartments. Accordingly, if you are buying in pre sale it is a good idea to get a detailed finish list from the developer. In addition to making sure the basic items are listed, get assurances regarding the quality levels, particularly with respect to windows (double pane helps to cut street noise) and kitchen.<br />
 </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;">2. <span lang="EN-US">Measurements. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">The condominium law in Panama provides a very specific method for measuring the area of an apartment, which is quite different from the US and Europe. In essence, Article 74 of the condominium law requires area to be calculated from the middle of the apartment’s perimeter walls in, with interior and exterior space treated equally. There are no reductions made for bathrooms, closets, balconies, etc. This measurement is used in the public deed and in calculating the price. Because the measurement is taken from the middle of the perimeter walls ust about the only way that one can measure an apartment in Panama legally is from the blue prints, with confirmatory measurements in situ.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt;text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US"><span>3. </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Construction Price Increases.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US">It is standard in Panama for pre-construction sales contracts to include a provision allowing the developer to raise the sale price by up to 10% if construction cost increase beyond projections. The purpose of this clause is to protect the developer from inflammation, not to allow it to pass mistakes off to the buyers or increase its profit margins. In fact, most reputable developers would rather eat a little inflation in their margins rather than gain a reputation for invoking this clause. While you may not be able to negotiate this clause out of the purchase contract, it is worth investigating the developer’s history to learn whether and under what circumstances it has invoked the clause in the past. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>

Casco Antiguo, Plaza Herrera</p>
<p>For the last two years, La Casona de las Brujas has been the center of the Panamanian bohemian scene. The space located at the old Maria Imaculada School near Plaza Herrera served as art gallery, concert hall, disco, art school for local children and just the favorite afterhours neighborhood hang out. </p>
<p>A little bit like gypsies, La Casona model is based on &#8220;opening&#8221; spaces in unrestored buildings until they are up for restoration, giving the building life and sometimes breaking into areas that aren´t well known. Two years ago, Plaza Herrera was considered dangerous and undesirable. La Casona opened the eyes of young and not so young until it was synonim of <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>. This year, the building of La Inmaculada will be restored, and therefore la Casona has closed its doors there&#8230; only to open them again almost next door!</p>
<p>This time at the iconic <a title="City Bank to the right" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/citibak.aspx" target="_blank">City Bank</a>, right on the other side of the Plaza. So don´t fear! the party will still go on&#8230;</p>
<p>Here are some images of last night´s party. A great performance from the band Reggae Roots!</p>
<p>Thanks girls! keep up the good work&#8230;<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Panama´s National Theatre was literally born with the Republic. The need to build it was at the first Gacetas Oficiales in 1903 - 1904 along with main stuff like a Presidential Palace and public bathrooms. It was the heart of social life and culture. Today, we celebrate its 100 year anniversary with a bit of history and wonderful events in August and October. Check out my Virtual Tour! ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Panama, Casco Viejo</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</span></span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Back in my university days, I did a paper on Panama’s National Theatre in <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>. Although looking back it was pretty much incomplete, naïve and badly written, I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed researching for it. For me, the <a title="Virtual Tour" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/teatronacional.aspx" target="_blank">National Theatre </a>is like a second home, a place that saw me grow up while dancing. It’s history has always been from glory to disaster, and then to glory again. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">One of the things that made me laugh at the top of my lungs was the first “Gaceta Oficial” ( the newspaper where the government publishes the laws when they are approved) where they mentioned the need to build a theatre. Panama, back in 1903 was not much more than a village. Literally the document said something along these lines: “And we will dedicate the sum of (I think it was) a million dollars to build: the presidential house, a school, public bathrooms, a theatre”.<span>  </span>The list for sure included some other things, but back then Panama was so basic that they had to build public bathrooms and a place for the brand new elected government to meet. And the Theatre became this place in more than one occasion. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Another “picture” in my mind that made me smile was the Theatre´s “code of conduct”. I remember it mentioned that ladies with feather hats should remove them, and gentlemen with tall hats. Also, you were not allowed to make noise with your walking stick (baston). The main balconies where assigned to the Fire Department, the central one to the President, and there was another one for the Major. The original theatre was made mostly out of wood (of course, no air conditioning) and when the car came into fashion it was necessary to change it because of the noise outside. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The Republic of Panama was literally being born, and the National Theatre was it´s social and cultural heart. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A beautiful article came out the other day at Ellas from La Prensa, celebrating the National Theatre´s 100 years. Written by Vannie Arrocha Morán, please search it out. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The original building where the theatre was later on built was actually a monastery for nuns. They had a small theatre called Sarah Bernahrdt, as it is said that the artist was once brought to perform there during the time of the French Canal. <span> </span>But the “Teatro Nacional” as we call it in Spanish, was built over the monastery and inaugurated in 1908 during the presidency of José Domingo de Obaldía. Its debut was grandiose, with the opera Aida presented by the Italian company Mario Lambardi.<span>  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The building was designed by Giussepe Ruggieri, one of the most prolific architects in Panama at the time. Roberto Lewis painted the ceiling frescoes, and Enrico Corrado did the chalk sculpture.<span>  </span>It was the time for optimism, so the Theatre had a lot of work showing all the well known operas from Carmen to La Traviatta. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Reaching the 30´s the theatre experiences its first fall. It hit bottom, as at some point it even got to be used as a movie theatre. Special note here: the National Theatre was the crème of the crème of San Felipe. However, Santa Ana had also its own jewel in Teatro Variedades. This Theatre in theory was aimed to the popular sectors which couldn’t pay the National Theatres´s fees. However, at least for the first period of splendor, the same opera or ballet company that would perform at the National Theatre one night would go to the Variedades the next night for a cheaper price. The story of both theatres sort of go hand by hand in this first period. When the National Theatre decays, Variedades bites the dust too. And if the National Theatre got to be a movie theatre, well… Variedades became a boxing ring and a movie theatre. When they where showing movies, the evening started with a ruffle between the public, the news, a comedy act, cartoons and then the movie. You could spend the entire evening there, and maybe even take a prize back home. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Back to the National Theatre, it got its first intervention in 1941 by the architect Guillermo de Roux. However, in the 70´s it fell again. The 70´s was a difficult time as it marked the beginning of the military regime. The Theatre got used for all sorts of things, including the school proms. In 1974 the architect René Brenes is hired to work on the theatre again. But by 1999 it was a disaster. I remember betting with my dancer friends when the chandelier was going to finally fall on top of everyone. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Well, the chandelier never got to fall, but the ceiling painting from Roberto Lewis. So in the year 2004 the Theatre went into a full rehab. For those who worked on this project they have said that the original proposal included much more stuff. However, from the stand point of a user at the backstage, it was a lot of work and the theatre really took back its dignity. I would have loved to see the original side gardens recovered and the café opened towards it creating a “café de la opera”, but well, maybe we had to leave something for next time. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">A 100 years old!

<p>We received a flash note from Quintessentially announcing their next &#8220;Silent Auction&#8221; of Fundacion San Felipe. This year, the 17th one, it will be held at the Marriott hotel, and all proceeds will go to their various programs ranging from art to photography for kids. This is usually a good place to get mostly Latinamerican Art.</p>
<p>There isn´t much in the internet about the Foundation, however, they´ve been in the area  for quite a while, working with children and taking care of the restoration of the San Felipe Neri church, which was their flag project, and now serves as headquarters for most of their programs.</p>
<p>The auction will be August 12th, and you can get the tickets through Quintessentially: <a title="mailto:qpanama@quintessentially.com?subject=Silent Auction for the San Felipe Foundation mailto:qpanama@quintessentially.com?subject=Silent Auction for the San Felipe Foundation" href="mailto:qpanama@quintessentially.com?subject=Silent%20Auction%20for%20the%20San%20Felipe%20Foundation">qpanama@quintessentially.com</a></p>
<p>Here is a picture of photographer Francisco Bech and his class. Francisco has been collaborating every summer with the Foundation for the last 3 years providing a photograph course for free to children in the area.<br />

Casco Viejo, San Felipe</p>
<p></a>This sunday, La Prensa ran a full page interview with <a title="Ariel Espino" href="http://www.centralamericaleadership.net/en/nilson_ariel_espino" target="_blank">Ariel Espino</a>, the Director of the Oficina del Casco Antiguo called usually OCA.  Here is the full article in Spanish and a brief summary in English.</p>
<p>Casco Antiguo has gone through an intense revitalization process. &#8220;In 10 years, you won´t be able to recognize it.&#8221; says Ariel Espino.</p>
<p>Next year is Panama´s election year. Most officials are presenting their reports and even more of them have started early their political campaigns. But the Office of Casco Antiguo has kept working and is looking to gain autonomy that will enable them to continue with long term policies and not be tied up to the political changes.  They are presenting a law that would create them as a Patronato, which would be a permanent figure, and would grant more freedom of action and sustainability.</p>
<p>The Oficina del Casco Antiguo has been quite busy. From cultural events to the urban planning of the Casco there are very few aspects where they aren´t present. It´s Director is a dinamyc architect with a passion for historic cities, which makes it perfect. In this interview, he speaks about the train project , the advances against speculation, the controversial projects at Hotel Central and the old Club Union. The Oficina del Casco Antiguo supports all tourism ventures in the Casco, specially hotels. Hotel Central got into trouble recently because they demolished protected structure. However, according to Espino, some of it was taken apart to be brought in again with the restoration. On the Club Union project he mentions that they already have plans at Patrimonio Historico pending for approvals. They are also waiting for the archeological study and environmental impact study.</p>
<p>He summarizes his balance after 4 years of working in the OCA by saying that the Casco has finally gained a momentum where about 20 or 30 projects are being built per year. He is glad this has been achieved and with the only 800 properties in the entire protected area this should be enough to transform the Casco radically in about 10 years. It won´t be &#8220;finished&#8221; but very different from what you can see today.</p>

<p class="texto">Con los cambios de gobierno, cada cinco años, históricamente ha habido también cambios de administración en la mayoría de las oficinas públicas, de manera que muchos de los proyectos de las diferentes entidades estatales quedan en suspenso o en abandono.</p>
<p class="texto">En el caso de la Oficina del Casco Antiguo (OCA), el año pasado se planteó la necesidad de darle mayor autonomía, para garantizar así la continuidad del plan maestro del barrio más antiguo de Panamá.</p>
<p class="texto">Aunque esto no se ha conseguido todavía, Ariel Espino, director ejecutivo de la OCA, explica que ya se tiene un borrador de anteproyecto de ley, que está en estudio en el Ministerio de Vivienda, y que debería entrar a discusión en la Asamblea Nacional en el próximo periodo de sesiones -en septiembre de este año-.</p>
<p class="texto">Pero mientras esto se decide, Espino ya puede hacer un balance de los cuatro años que lleva a cargo de la OCA y de los principales proyectos que se encuentran sobre la mesa.</p>
<p class="texto">¿Cómo va el proyecto de instalar un tranvía en el Casco Antiguo?</p>
<p class="texto">Hemos hecho tres consultorías, la tercera está por entregarse en agosto y esa es la última. Esta consultoría va a producir unos pliegos de licitación para la concesión del proyecto.</p>
<p class="texto">Lo que este consultor está preparando es un estimado de costos, rentabilidad, número estimado de usuarios, rutas, tecnología.</p>
<p class="texto">Eso no quiere decir que inmediatamente lo vamos a sacar a licitación, porque todavía tenemos que ver cuánto cuesta y qué rentabilidad tiene, pero este último trabajo nos va a decir mejor cómo lo podemos gestionar.</p>
<p class="texto">¿Tiene alguna idea de cuándo podría empezar a operar?</p>
<p class="texto">Está en una etapa final de estudio. <em>N</em>o me atrevería a dar fechas, pero cuando el proyecto ya está formulado, es mucho más fácil gestionarlo, ya sea con fondos disponibles o amarrarlo con otros proyectos de transporte público.</p>
<p class="texto">Ya se ven más propiedades en recuperación en el Casco, ¿significa esto que se ha avanzado en el control de la especulación?</p>
<p class="texto">Se ha avanzado&#8230; Era un problema grave en 2004 cuando empezamos en esta administración, porque aunque había una ley contra el abandono de edificios desde 1997, no se había aplicado ninguna multa. Ahora hay más de 60 procesos y algunos ya se han cobrado.</p>
<p class="texto">¿Y las propiedades condenadas?</p>
<p class="texto">La Dirección de Patrimonio Histórico [del Instituto Nacional de Cultura] está constantemente mandando cartas a los propietarios de los edificios que están en muy mal estado. Nosotros cooperamos con muchos procesos de desalojo, en especial cuando hay un proyecto de por medio.</p>
<p class="texto">¿Qué opinión tienen ustedes de los trabajos que se están haciendo en el Hotel Central?</p>
<p class="texto">El Hotel Central ha sido una preocupación de esta administración desde el inicio, porque fue el último gran hotel de la ciudad, está en una posición prominente y aquí hay una urgencia enorme de tener hoteles. Siempre ha habido pensiones y hoteles de mochileros, pero necesitamos ya la inversión de lujo.</p>
<p class="texto">Parte de la posibilidad de generar una economía turística en el Casco es tener a los turistas aquí, porque a veces el que viene en un tour no es el que más gasta .</p>
<p class="texto">Aun así, a los vecinos les preocupa que cada vez queda menos de esa estructura.</p>
<p class="texto">Las controversias han sido más por la modalidad de restauración o rehabilitación que se ha usado. Algunas personas hubieran preferido que se conservara más, pero mucho está conservado y guardado para reinstalarse en su momento.</p>
<p class="texto">Ahí se ha insistido mucho en que la fachada tiene que recuperarse. El primer patio es importantísimo -donde estaba la escalera- y se conserva parte de la escalera, pero mucho estaba muy deteriorado.</p>
<p class="texto">Son discusiones válidas que se dan con frecuencia, pero desde la perspectiva del futuro del Casco, la recuperación de ese edificio como un hotel será una pieza fundamental en el desarrollo del área.</p>
<p class="texto">El que no parece tener muchos avances es el proyecto en el antiguo Club Unión.</p>
<p class="texto">Para el Club Unión se aprobó un anteproyecto y la Dirección de Patrimonio Histórico está esperando los planos finales. Tengo entendido que no han llegado hasta el momento, pero sé que han estado adelantando [el propietario] con el estudio de impacto ambiental y con algo de arqueología. Y sí, son los dos proyectos hoteleros grandes en los que estamos interesados.</p>
<p class="texto">Tras cuatro años de gestión, ¿cuál es su balance y cuáles las tareas pendientes?</p>
<p class="texto">El Casco tiene más de 800 propiedades, la mayor parte en manos privadas. Significa que para restaurarlo se necesitan 800 proyectos, y no hay un barrio en Panamá que necesite de tantas construcciones.</p>
<p class="texto">Lo que necesitas es ver un centro histórico con 20 ó 30 proyectos iniciándose por año, lo que te da un ritmo lo suficientemente sostenido como para ver cambios dramáticos en 10 ó 15 años. Eso lo hemos conseguido y esperamos que no caiga. Pero estamos en un momento de auge inmobiliario, el Casco se ha beneficiado de eso y creo que a este ritmo, en 10 años más el Casco va a estar irreconocible. No estará terminado, pero sí muy distinto a lo que vemos hoy.</p>
<p class="texto"><strong>PERFIL</strong></p>

Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>
<p>From Today´s La Prensa:</p>
<p>Panama will have a Renaissance Hotel (by Marriott) by 2011. This announcement was made by Edward Fuller, president and executive director for Marriott International in the region, who mentioned this would be an investment of about 40 million dollars. &#8220;Panama´s economics are strong and the hotel industry is in constant growth&#8221;.  Renaissance Panama Hotel is expected to have 300 rooms and will be part of a mixed project which will include both residential and commercial real estate. The current Marriott hotel seems to be quite busy itself, as according to Fuller it is currently under expansion. An investment of another $10 million dollars resulting in a total of 376 rooms.</p>
<p>Finally, they are planning two more projects in Panama City: with Hotel Courtyard by Marriott Panama (will expand to 248 rooms) and the opening of another hotel near the commercial shopping mall Los Pueblos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/casco-viejo-cafe-due-web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-282" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/casco-viejo-cafe-due-web.jpg?w=160" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></a>A neighborhood is such a delicate fabric. Only now is Casco Viejo reaching  enough  residential critical mass to support, for example, a gourmet grocery store. It is funny, as it Super Gourmet in A Avenue has become the neighborhood equivalent of the &#8220;kitchen&#8221; at home, where all the family gathers while cooking and snacking.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">As the neighborhood develops, more and more services are needed, but space is always scarce. In the medium term future, hotels are coming into town, but even without them, short term rental apartments (which tend to do pretty well and basically work as a dispersed hotel throughout the Casco) bring a bit of a tourist traffic in need of other things.  We made a poll some months ago and the answers where incredible. From a laundry to a sushi bar, I think someone even mentioned somewhere to watch movies and a place to buy pots and plants. The community is coming together, a fantastic thing to experience. Not only through making business in the same neighborhood, but also supporting and being active in community programs. I remember someone dear once said: remember these days. These are the fun days. Once the neighborhood gets gentrified, you´ll be so bored. <a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/karavan-casco-antiguo-web.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-283" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/karavan-casco-antiguo-web.jpg?w=146" alt="" width="146" height="160" /></a></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">While I hope that day never comes, I have to say he was (and still is many times!) right. These are the fun days, where everything still has a twist, everything is hand made and each business has a heart behind it. Isn´t that the way it used to be? </span></span></p>

From the cradle of Western civilization to a huge melting pot, for those who have visited or lived in Rome it blows your mind away and steals a piece of your heart.

 <br />
Of course, it took over 2000 years for it to appreciate to that level, so salivating speculators in <a title="Casco Antiguo, Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama</a>, need not apply. But still, if you compound it all, what may seem crazy in today’s world is not buying a historic apartment in an urban center. What I learned from my recent trip was that human place value where life is most enjoyable.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt;"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><strong><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;"><span>1.<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">      </span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;">Human Scale: </span></strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> Never underestimate the power of a city that makes a person feel like one; where you are an important element of a beautiful city, not an afterthought behind your car. </span></span></p>
<figure style="width: 356px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img style="border:0;" src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/mini%20car.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="356" height="267" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mini Car</figcaption></figure>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Where you can walk both to get your groceries and to have fun. Where having a car is almost a nuisance.  Anyways, in today’s world of raising oil prices and global warming having a car and using it on a daily is almost prohibitive. Rome was bursting with people walking around or riding bikes. Every historic city I’ve ever been to is a heavily pedestrian/ bike site. Creative solutions have been thought to fit them into the space and be more efficient, but not all the way around. As size does matter, Rome is the land of the Smart Car, the “Cinquecento” (or Topolino as Italians call it), and the mini everything from public transportation to the garbage truck which can be operated with only one person. </span></span></p>
<figure style="width: 286px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img style="border:0;" src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Mini%20garbage%20car.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="286" height="214" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mini Garbage Truck</figcaption></figure>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">In yesterday’s world, it was just common sense. People clustered together because it was efficient.  In today’s world where time and resources are money, it is a matter of survival.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> <br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> <br />
This package moves around together. There is no way to get one without the others. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Rome</span></span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> is still in many ways the center of the world. It is chaotic, irreverent, eclectic and fun. A thousand voices speaking different languages, gothic kids in the sideways giving away flyers for a concert, businessmen in their Italian suits and Ferragamo shoes elbow to elbow with tourists and residents who are having a cappuccino at one of the many sidewalk cafés or gelatterias. Laundry on the balconies, rainbow flags on the windows. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">To my surprise, most buildings looked like they haven’t been painted in ages, and the ones that were didn’t have latex but lime based paint.  Nothing in Rome is or feels manicured. It looks and feels like an unexplored city with mysteries to be solved at every corner. No matter if it is by far the most visited city in Italy and probably Europe. People will visit and return countless times to learn more, to explore another corner, to see what has changed.<br />
 <br />
</span></span></p>
<div><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Stores cater to a wide mix of clients. There is something for everybody. High end along with cutting edge and artsy stuff. As a result, it never gets boring. At night, the fun still goes on. College students meeting in the plazas, romantic couples strolling. In the States, most people would meet at the bar to have a drink. In Italy they meet at the Gelateria to grab an icecream, wine or a café. No one really worries, as you can always walk back home.   </span></span></div>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Flipping through most real estate and lifestyle magazines they tend to show minimalist spaces with slick designs that make you wonder… where is the stuff? People live with a lot of stuff.  Very few will have antiseptic lives where your night bed table features only a thin design lamp and nothing else. Mine has piles of stuff, books, change, my ipod, CD´s, among many other things. Someone walking into my bedroom can clearly say like the Goldilocks story: someone lives here. Cities are made of people. They must be a logic reflection. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">So, if you ever step into a city that is so clean you can eat on the floor of the main plaza, every building is covered in a latex paint that reflects both the sun and your face, plus smells like plastic, gardens are unnaturally trimmed, there are no dogs or cats to be found, loud music shuts down at 9 p.m. and everybody looks just like you… wake up!</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Every year, Disney spends a lot of money to make you believe it is possible to have such a place and that you would be actually happy there. Truth is, for those cities that have attempted and somehow succeeded in making it happen, they are worldwide known as a) tourist traps or b) the most boring places on Earth. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">On the long run… which option holds more value? Probably the option where humans can get excited about new things and enjoy the multiple flavors coming his way. Because of the mix which brings the vibrancy, cities like Rome can look and be old, but keep hearts that are forever young and therefore relevant. </span></span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;">And as humans, we instinctively value this.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

There is something very human about wanting to live where we can touch, see, smell, enjoy, nature. Parks, gardens and pets have been the usual ways to incorporate this factor into urban settings and keep us connected. There are volumes written about the benefits of green spaces within cities. While some developers might see it as lost space, urbanists, majors and more importantly residents, know there is no valuable city without them.<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Historic cities are special because they where built around green spaces making them the daily meeting point. And limited space hasn’t been an obstacle for imagination and creativity:  roof terraces, walls and balconies have filled in with fantastic combinations of plants. </span></span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Green%20Rome%203.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="178" height="238" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">On historic cities there is a myth that everything has to be regulated in order to keep it truthful to what it was. Façades are carefully restored and not much visual objects are allowed. Rome, the ultimate European historic city, proves quite the contrary. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></span><img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Green%20Rome%201.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="315" height="236" />  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Green%20Rome%204.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="283" height="212" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">     <br />
<span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">There, balconies explode with plants, roof terraces have huge trees growing on them and many façades are covered if not completely at least partially with plants and vines. A refreshing twist: most of these gardens, even the ones on the plazas are edible gardens. Urban agriculture is huge, as the cost of food has increased tremendously. Every corner with some soil and sun is used to plant herbs and vegetables, a healthy and cheaper choice for today’s world. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Rome</span></span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> is unique. There is no other like it and no one is building another brand new Rome. If they were, it would obviously be a fake. Maybe Disney at some point will open a Rome pavilion with centurions dressed in costumes. I’m sure the Italian filmmaking company CineCittá has many of its buildings carved in foam. But at least on both examples the idea is to honestly create a fantasy. For those developers who have tried to replicate the style it has gone dead wrong and has ended up looking, feeling, smelling and therefore being really tacky. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"><br />
Historic cities can’t be replicated. And for those who hold the advantage of being near thriving cosmopolitan cities with a mix population, the combination for value is perfect. Scarcity and uniqueness are the two key elements of value. On the long run, historic cities tend to appreciate more than modern ones and to hold value better.  It is the difference between buying a Picasso or buying a full color poster of a Picasso painting. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> <br />
Summarizing all this to what brings us here: Casco Viejo, Panama.  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">You can probably recognize several of these elements in our beloved Casco Viejo. As an investment, it is still on an early cycle compared to any of its peers (including Cartagena, which is the closest one). To give you an idea, the best stuff in Cartagena is between $5,000 to $6,000 per mt2, almost double the price of Panama. The best properties in Italy (Rome) are over the $20,000 per mt2. The worst apartments at the Italian rural south (literally in the middle of nowhere and probably unrestored) are around $3,000 per mt2 which is the price for the best apartments in <a title="Casco Antiguo, Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama</a>, with views, amenities, parking, sometimes even with pool and elevator, a UNESCO protected site 5 minutes away from a cosmopolitan urban center and  30 minutes away from an international airport considered one of the biggest hubs in the region, not to mention 10 minutes away from the domestic airport in case you want to spend a weekend at the San Blas white sanded beaches learning from the Kuna indians or if you feel like stretching your legs hiking the Baru Volcano at Chiriqui. All these flights are less than an hour.<br />
 </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US">Again, for pure investors with a taste for instant flipping, here is a disclosure clause: appreciation is an organic process that takes time. You want to maximize your profits? You need to get involved, inject energy into the neighborhood and promote actively content that would add texture.  Come on! It is actually fun. No time for it?  Consider donating. From the Scouts to all the social programs of Fundacion Calicanto, from the music festivals to opening your commercial space or your building to young artists in need of space, there are tons of things you can do to increase the value on the neighborhood and therefore your property that doesn’t require much. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> If not for altruism, then just because it is good business. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[The best of the Casco Viejo and the French Expats gathered yesterday to celebrate France´s most important holiday. The party was at Plaza Francia (of course!). Check out photos of the celebration, along with historic photos as far as 1923 of other celebrations, including the inauguration itself of Plaza de Francia.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> <a title="Casco Antiguo, Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Panama, Casco Viejo<br />
Casco Antiguo, Plaza Francia<br />
</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, with noisy and entretaining fireworks and a very nice party the French Embassy celebrated their Bastille Day at Plaza de Francia in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx">Casco Viejo</a>, also known as Las Bovedas. Since I know very little about French history, I checked out Wikipedia and found this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Quatorze Juillet&#8221; (Fourteenth of July in <a title="French language" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/wiki/French_language">French</a>) is <a title="Bastille Day" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/wiki/Bastille_Day">Bastille Day</a>, the French national holiday celebrating the <a title="Fête de la Fédération" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/wiki/F%C3%AAte_de_la_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration">Fête de la Fédération</a> in 1790 during the <a title="French Revolution" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/wiki/French_Revolution">French Revolution</a>.<br />
I know I should learn more about history, but I think in a way it was difficult to know exactly what the revolution was about or what exactly was being celebrated as the first stand in the party I got to was the L´Oreal stand with a makeup artist working his magic on a lady. The municipal band was playing sort of marches, maybe that was it. But maybe what they were celebrating, more than anything else, was the French spirit itself when they claimed Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.</p>
<p>I thought giving you some pictures from last night celebrations, as well as a historic picture back in the days when Plaza Francia was only &#8220;Las Bovedas&#8221;, the place where the Spanish government kept the jails. It is also the place where they would perform most official acts like executions, even later on when we became part of Colombia, we had one of our martirs called Victoriano Lorenzo shot in that very plaza. Plaza Francia has seen a lot. And I´m sure part of what inspired the &#8220;founding fathers&#8221; of our country to separate from Colombia back then form the republic was pretty much based on the spirit of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>So&#8230; Viva La France! </p>

To know how a country is doing on the investment side, my taxi driver is called hotel occupation. Who is showing up and how frequently will tell you a lot about the current state and the future of a place. Check out the latest Panama news!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><a title="Panama Casco Viejo Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com" target="_blank">Panama</a></span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><a title="Panama Casco Viejo Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com" target="_blank">, Casco Viejo<br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</a></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><a title="Panama Casco Viejo Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com" target="_blank"><br />
When I was studying my career in tourism back in the late 90´s (incredible but true, I actually went to the university to study tourism) reported hotel occupancy in Panama was between 40 to 50% for the luckiest guys. Back then, the &#8220;big names&#8221; where Hotel El Panama and the Caesar Park which later on was converted into a Marriott and then a Caesar Park again. Reports suggested the top occupancy to be at 54%. The main tourist was the business man and most hotels marketed themselves as corporate hotels. The only true “eco” hotel was the Canopy Tower and the Gamboa Resort was trying very hard to hit the mass market with the eco concept, hardly surviving with their huge infrastructure.</p>
<p></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12pt;"><span lang="EN-US">The peaks of the season were the conventions made at ATLAPA. Usually Expocomer, or ExpoAnythingWeCouldGet. The normal businessman stayed 2 or maybe 3 days. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12pt;"><span lang="EN-US">Today, ten years later, it is a very different story. Panama recovered slowly after its Noriega affair and made it to the news as a place to invest. Since then, a lot has changed, the city is booming and forgotten places like Casco Viejo are being revitalized. It is a challenge to get a room in high season, but low season is also quite busy these days. According to the new reports, hotel occupancy is at 66.5% and hotels are quickly building more rooms, which makes me think they are not really at 66.5% at all but at least around the 80%. <span> </span>The Decameron group on its beach hotel claimed a year ago they were reaching the 90% occupancy (maybe more?) and by my own personal experience trying to get rooms for friends outside <a title="Casco Viejo, Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>I´m sure my guess isn´t too far off. Hotels are being marketed as lifestyle hotels with spas, casinos and a lot of other amenities. Oh, yes, they still have their business centers. Just in case! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12pt;"><span lang="EN-US">An article came out in the Panama America today about this. They mentioned that, according to the Ministry of Tourism Bureau, the standard tourist stay is now 6 days. This means it is more of a real tourist, someone who is coming not for business (or not only for business) but to enjoy as well. According to the note (see below) there are 16,000 hotel rooms in Panama, from which at least 9,000 are in the main Panama City. Their goal is to reach 24,000 by year 2010. </span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[It is never too late to get in the tech train, and finally, after more than 4 years of experiencing continuous growth between 6% and 10% a year Panama has realized it needs to build its e commerce capacity. Check out the brand new law... you can even download it! ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Panama, Casco Viejo<br />
Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</a></p>
<p>Well, I can´t say it is a new concept. Panama is probably at least 20 years late on this one, but that doubles the reason to celebrate. Finally (and I suspect some companies where already doing it) the government decided to create a law to be able to do commerce online (meaning doing transactions and taking credit cards online). As someone once said: &#8220;a small step for a man, a big step for mankind&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Curiously enough, some years ago a few government visionaries started the process of transforming all physical files in their institutions into digital files. Suddenly, costs where less and efficiency was up to the roof for &#8220;government&#8221; standards. Of course, you would say&#8230; hey, I could have told them that. But you know, it is the government. Finally they are catching up. So they got all excited about it, and the next thing you know there are all sorts of things like websites for each institution with most or at least some of the forms you need to process stuff, and you can even declare your rent online (<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dgi.gob.pa">www.dgi.gob.pa</a>).  They claim you can even start to process your visa online, although if you are reading this&#8230; please, get a good lawyer (<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pasaporteordinario.gob.pa">www.pasaporteordinario.gob.pa</a> ).</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pasaporteordinario.gob.pa">www.panamaemprende.gob.pa</a> you can open a company. If you have requested a work permit you are supposed to be able to follow up your status at <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mitradel.gob.pa">www.mitradel.gob.pa</a>, and believe it or not you can even check on what the government is buying at <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mitradel.gob.pa">www.panamacompra.gob.pa</a>. This is a huge improvement for the government, especially with the many complaints on lack of transparency and corruption. But what about the private sector?</p>
<p>Panama bursts with websites. All of them offering information, but they don´t tend to be able to do transactions in them. Some companies found ways to &#8220;loop&#8221; by being able to take your request and charge you then by phone. You are able to order all your groceries at the online <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rimith.com%2fweb%2findex.aspx">Riba Smith</a> supermarket, but you can´t pay online. The bookstore Exedra Books will take your order and deliver to wherever you are, but they can´t charge you through their website. Until now.</p>
<p>Although notice banks have been using online commerce for a long time now. Everyone except <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.banconal.com.pa%2f">Banco Nacional </a>which still has a shamefull archaic method. You can´t even check your account online. You have to physically go to one of their agencies, do a huge line and finally talk to an agent which will look at you really nasty if your bank account was open in Chiriqui but you are requesting  your status printed at the Panama agency. I´ve personally been through this.  They actually require you to request it in writting. Really&#8230;  as ridiculous as this sounds to you, this is how things used to work before internet. Shame they haven´t realized that was at least 30 years ago.</p>
<p>But one of the main achievements of the law is to recognize and have a protocol for e signatures. Airlines like Copa has been doing business online for a long time now, although I suspect they use a US website and system since they were connected to Continental Airlines until a while ago.</p>
<p>One of the big private companies that has jumped in first is <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=c972c127-1248-4e25-977d-a0e17e4d1b3e&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.smrey.com%2fsmr%2findex.asp">El Rey</a>, one of Panama´s main supermarket chains. They are implementing a system for all their providers, which is a complicated net of really huge companies and Aunt Maria home businesses. The challenge is to get everyone on the same page so the communication can actually get done. Because El Rey has posts all throughout the country, providing equipment and trainning to every provider will be a crazy process, but will force a big part of the country to jump into the new technology fast. And once you are there, you become an addict, as we all know.</p>
<p>The one handicap of all this is that most websites are still in spanish, except the tourism and real estate websites. So much to get done!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Walking around in Avenida A and Calle Primera in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx">Casco Antiguo </a>near the Bovedas, you  can find several little shops with souvenirs and different things to keep a memory of your visit of  Panama.  If you are a tourist and even if you are from Panama, there are a lot of items which can look well in your house and closet.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The unique designs that Daisy uses with the mola’s on her clothes calls everybody attention; playing with colors and geometric figures in order to have a unique piece which is your own.  She has been working with molas for twenty years.  The actual molas are made by the Kunas, the colorfully dresses of one of the best known indigenous tribes in Panama (there are 7 different tribes). The only material used in the design is cotton. The Kunas take Daisy’s design and execute them according to her instructions. Daisy’s  creativity and work  surprises a lot of people that don´t know that a  mola  can be adapted for many uses  such as a purse, belt, baby clothes, for CD cases and even eyeglass cases.  Pillows are popular also. The uses are unlimited.  Through the years, she has built a loyal clientele. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Daisy has been working in Casco Antiguo for 40 years ago; her son drives her from Parque Lefevre to Casco Antiguo every morning   to open the shop by 8:00 a.m.  As a young girl, Daisy grew up on Calle 4 and Avenida A so she likes to be near her old neighborhood.   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For all these years Artesania Daisy has never done any marketing other than opening her door and relying on her colorful shop to attract clientele.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Last night I went to the opening of the show "15000 Watts" at La Casona de Brujas in Plaza Herrera. The show is a meditation on the current energy crisis, in Panama, in the world, and how it touches all of us at different levels. From the everyday experiences to the hydro plant. The most important part of it all was not so much how electricity has changed our lifestyle to make it more comfortable and allows us to think at a higher level (or not think..) but a question o whether we are able to leave this comfort zone and take action, join efforts and help solve this crisis.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p> <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Panama, Casco Antiguo</a><br />
Casco Viejo, Plaza Herrera</p>
<p>Last night I went to the opening of the show &#8220;15000 Watts&#8221; at La Casona de Brujas in Plaza Herrera.  The show is a meditation on the current energy crisis, in Panama, in the world, and how it touches all of us at different levels.</p>
<p>It combined photos and paintings from both artist <a title="Miguel Lombardo" href="http://alquimiagroup.org/Alquimia/alquimia.artistas.html" target="_blank">Miguel Lombardo</a> and <a title="Cartooch" href="http://www.cartooch.com/" target="_blank">Cartooch</a>. Miguel, in a more dramatic tone and Cartooch using their children-like style, it was a good combination on such a serious issue.  Most of the pieces by Cartooch had buttons to &#8220;turn on&#8221; the lights which iluminated brains, eyes and heart.</p>
<p>There was also a piece on bringing awareness to natural spaces through the use of impossible to miss orange cubes. This experiment started a while ago, I remember driving through Balboa Avenue and pam! suddenly these big orange cubes glowing at night, or &#8220;just hanging out&#8221; there during the day. I said to myself&#8230; what is this??? Then I met Miguel and he explained how the intention was to focus the attention on the bits of nature we take for granted within the city. Later on he did it in one of <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo´s</a> beaches, and from there on to other places.</p>
<p>Another big piece was made out of photographs of the areas where the energy companies have projects to build dams and hydroelectric plants. Most of these areas are inhabited by indians, so it becomes more of a social issue. On one hand, Panama´s electricity is not only becoming very expensive but also scarce. We have the Canal resources to bring hydro electricity and some other plants, but we are growing as a nation, so electricity becomes a big issue. Panamanians are experiencing the raise of the cost of energy and claim for more plants, which are only feasable in a couple of places. Without the proper integration of the communities to these very necessary projects a huge missunderstanding is caused.  I can see myself in both sides: we need energy and cheaper. They want to stay in the land they´ve been for some years. It is the dynamic tension of our world today.</p>
<p>What about solar? studies say that there is not enough sunlinght in Panama to feed the city, just 5 months a year, maybe. What about winds? we have winds, but not enough. And so the list goes. In the meanwhile, costs raise and availability diminishes.</p>
<p>The other big issue is efficiency of lines. So many times the government isn´t able to repair and organize the cables in the right way.</p>
<p>Back in a corner, there is a very special box. It is, for me, the most important one. A question is written on the wall: &#8220;Should we keep allowing this?&#8221;  It is our call to action.</p>
<p>The problems were identified a long time ago, but it is only through our actions that we can provoke change.</p>
<p>What am I going to do about this?</p>
<p>Two boxes are provided, one with a yes and another one with a no, and papers so you can provide your input.   But is that enough?</p>
<p>As I´ve come to learn about our recent experiment on the Urban Composter Contest, most of us feel we don´t have the time to take action. We would love to, and we get outraged with the energy crisis or the huge expenses of resources. </p>
<p>But are we really able to get out of our comfort zone and do something about it?</p>
<p>humm&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Antiguo<br />
Casco Viejo, Plaza Herrera</p>
<p>
Last night I went to the opening of the show &#8220;15000 Watts&#8221; at La Casona de Brujas<br />
in Plaza Herrera.&nbsp; The show is a meditation on the current energy crisis, in<br />
Panama, in the world, and how it touches all of us at different levels.</p>
<p>It combined photos and paintings from both artist Miguel Lombardo and Cartooch. Miguel,<br />
in a more dramatic tone and Cartooch using their children-like style, it was a good<br />
combination on such a serious issue.&nbsp; Most of the pieces by Cartooch had buttons<br />
to &#8220;turn on&#8221; the lights which iluminated brains, eyes and heart.</p>
<p>There was also a piece on bringing awareness to natural spaces through the use of<br />
impossible to miss orange cubes. This experiment started a while ago, I remember driving<br />
through Balboa Avenue and pam! suddenly these big orange cubes glowing at night, or<br />
&#8220;just hanging out&#8221; there during the day. I said to myself&#8230; what is this??? Then<br />
I met Miguel and he explained how the intention was to focus the attention on the<br />
bits of nature we take for granted within the city. Later on he did it in one of Casco´s<br />
beaches, and from there on to other places.</p>
<p>Another big piece was made out of photographs of the areas where the energy companies<br />
have projects to build dams and hydroelectric plants. Most of these areas are inhabited<br />
by indians, so it becomes more of a social issue. On one hand, Panama´s electricity<br />
is not only becoming very expensive but also scarce. We have the Canal resources to<br />
bring hydro electricity and some other plants, but we are growing as a nation, so<br />
electricity becomes a big issue. Panamanians are experiencing the raise of the cost<br />
of energy and claim for more plants, which are only feasable in a couple of places.<br />
Without the proper integration of the communities to these very necessary projects<br />
a huge missunderstanding is caused.&nbsp; I can see myself in both sides: we need<br />
energy and cheaper. They want to stay in the land they´ve been for some years. It<br />
is the dynamic tension of our world today.</p>
<p>What about solar? studies say that there is not enough sunlinght in Panama to feed<br />
the city, just 5 months a year, maybe. What about winds? we have winds, but not enough.<br />
And so the list goes. In the meanwhile, costs raise and availability diminishes.</p>
<p>The other big issue is efficiency of lines. So many times the government isn´t able<br />
to repair and organize the cables in the right way.</p>
<p>Back in a corner, there is a very special box. It is, for me, the most important one.<br />
A question is written on the wall: &#8220;Should we keep allowing this?&#8221;&nbsp; It is our<br />
call to action.</p>
<p>The problems were identified a long time ago, but it is only through our actions that<br />
we can provoke change.</p>
<p>What am I going to do about this?</p>
<p>Two boxes are provided, one with a yes and another one with a no, and papers so you<br />
can provide your input.&nbsp;&nbsp; But is that enough?</p>
<p>As I´ve come to learn about our recent experiment on the Urban Composter Contest,<br />
most of us feel we don´t have the time to take action. We would love to, and we get<br />
outraged with the energy crisis or the huge expenses of resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But are we really able to get out of our comfort zone and do something about it?</p>
<p>humm&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

<p>The results so far are very interesting: it is by far our most visited post, one of the most read, clicked, both in spanish and english&#8230; but only until a week ago did we get our first (and so far only!) application. I can only guess the fast pace of our lives bury all of our good intentions to do something about the environment, but not our thoughts: meaning we all think about it, but most likely we just don´t have the time to do it.</p>
<p>We even got calls from journalist and got two articles: one online from EFE and another one on a local magazine (Ellas).  But only one application: &#8220;The Rodrigo&#8221;.</p>
<p>The system received promises to be a fun project to engage comunity kids. It was submited by Beth Ihle, Tamara, Nathalee and Jen Hanna who are currently working in Costa Rica, at a eco-friendly wellness retreat. We are currently working on the technical details of how to fit them in our balconies, Spencer had some great ideas that could improve the system. Also, painted by kids, it will become a great masterpiece of Casco Viejo´s urban art.</p>
<p>To Beth, Tamara, Nathalee and Jen&#8230; thank you!!!! thanks for taking the time for all of us and thanks for your enthusiastic pictures.</p>

<p>It almost sounds like the title of an experimental movie! but well, I had so many little pictures and happenings this weekend and upcoming week I couldn´t just &#8220;cluster&#8221; them in a theme.</p>
<p>First, of course, the tomatoes.  For those of you following my little composting mission, well, my balcony has has started to provide tomatoes! It has been so easy, it is unbelievable. And more is sprouting, I can´t wait to see what is what!</p>
<p>Now, second, but no less important, our friend and artist Miguel Lombardo will have a good photographic exhibition starting this Thursday at La Casona de Brujas. Inaugurates May 30th to June 22nd. The show is a meditation on today´s energy crisis.</p>
<p>Finally, this weekend was the aniversary of the district of San Felipe. It was celebrated out loud with a big fair at Plaza Catedral, a folk music concert and (today) the procesion of Saint Felipe Neri. Of course, with tons of music, yellow balloons and dancing. <a title="Casco viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">This town is fun!</a></p>

   of Architecture, Art and Planning at Cornell University (New York). The exhibition<br />
   presents a view of the urban system in the Canal Zone, situating its development within<br />
   a particular tradition of urban and regional planning, and focusing on the work of<br />
   North American professionals and intellectuals such as Clarence Stein, Frederick Law<br />
   Olmsted, and others, whose ideas influenced urban development in the Canal Zone. The<br />
   exhibition consists of 30 photographs, as well as bilingual text panels (Spanish and<br />
   English). The exhibition’s creators will present a lecture about the exhibition as<br />
   part of the Biennial’s conference program

   Presentation of Canal Zone (1976), a documentary by Frederic Wiseman
</p>
<p class="style5" align="left">
   This documentary about U.S. citizens who lived and worked in the Canal Zone sheds<br />
   light on their lifestyle and different aspects of their civilian government, as well<br />
   as on the work of the military forces, thereby portraying the social structure of<br />
   the so-called Zonians. Wiseman has been acknowledged over the past three decades as<br />
   one of the most important filmmakers in the United States.

<div class="style3" align="left">Brooke Alfaro: Recent Paintings
</div>
<p class="style5" align="left">
   Within the framework of the Biennial, Panama’s well known artist Brooke Alfaro will<br />
   present, for the first time in several years, an exhibition of his paintings.
</p>
<p class="style5" align="left">
   Brooke Alfaro (Panama 1949) graduated in 1976 as an architect from the University<br />
   of Panama. He studied painting at the Art Students League in New York from 1980 to<br />
   1983. Since the early 1990s, his painting evolved from a technique close to the classical<br />
   masters towards a radical transformation in form with the aim not only of manipulating<br />
   pictorial space, but of expressing specific spiritual and psychological states. Both<br />
   in his paintings and his videos (a medium he has worked in since 1999), a major part<br />
   has been played by Alfaro’s humble neighbors from the historic area of San Felipe,<br />
   where the artist used to live and continues to visit. In both genres, he employs a<br />
   caustic sense of humor and deceptive jokes that subvert the possible interpretations<br />
   of his artwork. (A.Samos)
</p>
<p><span class="style3">ACTIVITIES IN 2007</span></p>
<p class="style3" align="left">
   Educational Workshops about Contemporary Art Practices
</p>
<p class="style5" align="left">
   The 8th Biennial will develop, during 2007 and 2008, a program of educational activities<br />
   directed at compensating, at least in part, for the lack of opportunities available<br />
   for learning about contemporary art in Panama. A total of 35 participants took part<br />
   in the two workshops carried out in 2007, including artists, art professors, and others<br />
   interested in improving their artistic education. The workshops were:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="style5" align="left">
   • <span class="style10">Art Photography Appreciation Workshop.</span> A one-week course<br />
   on the theory and history of photography, with the participation of fifteen artists,<br />
   taught by well-known Panamanian artist and photographer Rachelle Mozman.
</p>
<p class="style5" align="left">
   • <span class="style10">Seminar: “Reflections on contemporary Art”. </span>A one-week<br />
   course on the theory and history of contemporary art, with the participation of twenty<br />
   artists and art professors, taught by Saidel Brito, Academic Coordinator of the prestigious<br />
   Instituto Superior Tecnológico de Artes del Ecuador (ITAE), located in Guayaquil.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style3" align="left">
   Premiere presentation of the documentary Curundú by Ana Endara
</p>
<p class="style5" align="left">
   Produced between 2006 and 2007, with the sponsorship of the Fondo de Fomento al Audiovisual<br />
   de Centroamérica y el Caribe, Curundú is the opera prima of young Panamanian filmmaker<br />
   Ana Endara. Its premiere and a round table discussion about the film were held on<br />
   the 4th of December 2007 at the historic Ancon Theater Guild. Kenneth, the main character,<br />
   is a charismatic figure who earns his living by taking pictures of his neighbors in<br />
   Curundú, an overpopulated and precarious community, located not too far from the historic<br />
   center of Panama City, on the edge of the former Canal Zone. The documentary speaks<br />
   to us about Curundú through Kenneth and his photos.

		<description><![CDATA[Properties in historic areas that have gone through a revitalization process tend to always appreciate. To the point they become very expensive. In Panama, it is still way below the prices of their peers, but quickly getting to match them as new projects get restored and more energy goes into the system. Price ranges such as $350,000 and below might very well disappear soon. Learn about it while you are still on time. ]]></description>

<div style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:x-small;">One of the things we enjoy the most is matching a future neighbor with the right property for his needs and budget. We take pride in showing not only our options, but everything we know is available that fits their requests.</span></div>
<div style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:x-small;">In this issue we decided to review  everything on the market for less than $350,000. As the Casco continues to develop, this price point will get harder to find. We´d like to think that there will always be great apartments available for under $350,000, but based on the performance of other revitalized historic centers, we are not so sure. </span></div>
<div style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:x-small;">Looking for a studio, a pied á terre, or a comfortable two bedroom with parking? Maybe a commercial space? Now may be a good moment. </span></div>

<p>Back in 1998 things where quite different in <a title="Casco Antiguo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>. It was more Viejo than Casco. It was a fragile, run down, un protected site most people in Panama (government and not) had &#8220;written off&#8221;.  Back then, a group of passionate profesionals stood up and basically made it happen: brought the attention of <a title="UNESCO" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> and worked until this endangered species was protected for life.</p>
<p>One of the most important axis of this petition was Fundacion Calicanto. For years, they worked very hard to propose a law to protect these wonderful buildings, creating the foundations for all the appreciation we see today.</p>
<p>Some years have passed and with the buildings protected, Calicanto has changed its focus towards the human patrimony of the Casco Antiguo. They have great programs we can all be part of. From trainning women in hotel skills to art courses for children and urban agriculture, their goal is to attack the roots of poverty through providing tools to the local population that will enable them to be part of the growth of their own neighborhood, and through this, revitalize themselves.</p>
<p>Our Casco Viejo is so small and helping is so easy. Making a real difference takes very little. We welcome you to join the Foundation and be part of their programs. You can volunteer time or resources&#8230; or both!</p>
<p>To contact Heriberto Trejos (Calicanto´s Director) , just write to: <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;"><a href="mailto:fcalicanto@gmail.com">fcalicanto@gmail.com</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">To learn more about Casco Viejo, don´t forget to visit us at: <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com">www.arcoproperties.com</a> .  Our company donates every year 10% of its income to charity in Casco Viejo, most of it to Fundacion Calicanto. Buying through Arco Properties truly makes a difference. </span></p>

<p>Back in 1998 things where quite different in Casco Viejo. It was more Viejo than Casco.<br />
It was a fragile, run down, un protected site most people in Panama (government and<br />
not) had &#8220;written off&#8221;.&nbsp; Back then, a group of passionate profesionals stood<br />
up and basically made it happen: brought the attention of UNESCO and worked until<br />
this endangered species was protected for life.</p>
<p>One of the most important axis of this petition was Fundacion Calicanto. For years,<br />
they worked very hard to propose a law to protect these wonderful buildings, creating<br />
the foundations for all the appreciation we see today.</p>
<p>Some years have passed and with the buildings protected, Calicanto has changed its<br />
focus towards the human patrimony of the Casco Antiguo. They have great programs we<br />
can all be part of. From trainning women in hotel skills to art courses for children<br />
and urban agriculture, their goal is to attack the roots of poverty through providing<br />
tools to the local population that will enable them to be part of the growth of their<br />
own neighborhood, and through this, revitalize themselves.</p>
<p>Our Casco Viejo is so small and helping is so easy. Making a real difference takes<br />
very little. We welcome you to join the Foundation and be part of their programs.<br />
You can volunteer time or resources&#8230; or both!</p>

   any direct waterviews from the apartment itself. However, it is on the last level<br />

   practice the apartments on the upper floor are always the ones to use this amenity<br />
   more, so you get it, but you are not being charged for it!&nbsp; Your front views<br />
   are street views.&nbsp; Keep in mind Terraplen is at an early stage of restoration.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Meditating about what has value and what doesn´t is a profound activity, almost zen-like. It has to do with the fundamentals of the property, but on a bigger picture even that is subdued to one and only factor: what makes a human happy.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/casco-antiguo-sunday-stroll.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-101" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/casco-antiguo-sunday-stroll.jpg?w=300" alt="Casco Viejo Sunday Strolling is an art" width="300" height="225" /></a>Some months ago I went to a charade organized by a developer friend who wanted to gather not only ideas but the best concepts on urban living in order to develop an island in the Pacific archipelago of Las Perlas. I only got to a couple of sessions but it was very, very, very interesting. It was coordinated by a very smart and experienced urbanist from the States ( I think he might have some Cuban origins) but really the ones who did all the work where the audience. And note, not everyone was an architect! but it didn´t matter, as what was in discussion was human lifestyle, happiness and common sense.</p>
<p>It was profoundly interesting, almost a zen meditation on how we carry on our every human movement. They talked about the city as this living thing that was born and made to the image of humans. But of course, once we were smart enough to create the wheel and therefore cars, we felt comfortable getting to &#8220;no other man has gone before&#8221; and spread our cement around. What was born as a vertical living in a very small but higher populated center where everything was walking distance turned into a horizontal lifestyle where nothing could be walked to, only driven to.</p>
<p>So the entire scale changed, and then we did.</p>
<p>Studies exposed during this conference (and later throughout my reading) point out that the happiest people on Earth today are the ones who actually don´t need to take a car to go through their week. They walk from home to work, stopping by their favorite café site in the middle. On their way back home, they stop at the neighborhood deli and shop for fresh fruits, vegetables, etc. or simply go out to have dinner with friends around the corner. Their favorite bar, art gallery, theatre, gym, etc is probably 4 or 5 blocks away, walking distance is the key. The other one is content.</p>
<p>And stop to think about it. Humans love to be with other humans (well, in general). That is the entire point of people going to the opera or the theatre, there is a &#8220;skin to skin&#8221; communication, even if you don´t talk to the guy next to you. People tend to be more relaxed in those environments. They don´t rush rush, or if they do, it is just different.</p>
<p>But where are these places? mostly in &#8230;  <a title="Casco Antiguo lifestyle" href="http://site-h-com.i-dialogue1.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,e94e4de8-4208-4783-914b-b70bc08f4949.aspx" target="_blank">Full story here! </a></p>

I know most people feel a serious ceremony should be more appropiate, but so far I haven´t seen any procession here that is not filled with music, ballons and flowers. This is so tied up to our Panamanian point of view on everything! it is all about having fun.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;color:#000080;font-family:Verdana;"><span style="font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Verdana;">I asked around (I´m such an ignorant in these matters) and they told me it was San Pancracio, one of the saints &#8220;for work&#8221;. I found this small summary on the saint, I´m sorry I couldn´t find anything in English. Enjoy the pictures below!</span></span><strong><br />

<p><span style="font-size:x-small;color:#000080;font-family:Verdana;"><strong>Devoción</strong></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size:x-small;color:#000080;font-family:Verdana;">La devoción a San Pancracio se fue propagando a lo largo de los años por Occidente e incluso en Oriente, en buena parte gracias a la narración de su pasión que fue redactada antes del siglo IX. Dos atractivos hay en el santo que ayudaron a su veneración: la pronta edad de su martirio y los milagros que por su intercesión le fueron atribuidos. Cabe no olvidarnos del gran aprecio que suscita el santo en Inglaterra, allí, San Agustín de Cantérbury le dedicó una iglesia a finales del siglo VI.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size:x-small;color:#000080;font-family:Verdana;">Aunque el patrón de los trabajadores sea San José, San Pancracio es también otro de los santos a quien mucha gente recurre para encontrar trabajo. También se le invoca para obtener buena salud. Como que la pasión del martirio nos cuenta que fue decapitado, hay también quien le reza para combatir la migraña. Otra de sus virtudes es la de proteger contra el perjurio y el falso testimonio. Cabe destacar que los tejedores y todo el arte del ramo textil de Barcelona adoptaron a mediados del siglo XIX a San Pancracio como patrón. En el día de su onomástica celebraban una gran fiesta.  Este patronazgo cayó en desuso a finales del mismo siglo y hoy por hoy, los tejedores ya no le veneran. Recuerda que el patrón de este ramo está compartido entre San Francisco de Asís y San Martín de Tours.</span></p>

<p>How was it that Panama lost it´s beach lifestyle, I don´t really know. I am glad, though, that this extint way of lifestyle (for the modern Panama City) is still very much alive here. Granted, you won´t see girls running around in bikinis or guys in tight pants, but it is really enjoyable and relaxed. Next Sunday you are around, don´t forget to visit them!  ps. just don´t get into the water yet, we are still working on that one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>A classic scene: tourist wants to go to <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>and asks a taxi driver to take him. The taxi says, oh no, it is dangerous. Don´t go there.  Actually, ask most Panamanians and you are crazy to even consider living here. But somehow a miracle happens: the visitor (now really curious about the place) gets to Casco Viejo&#8230; and has a blast.  Interviews people living in the area, and everywhere they tell him is quite &#8220;tranquilo&#8221;. Notices that somehow, even where there are obvious economic differences among the population, the community as a whole seems to work very well and everyone mingles.</p>
<p>The reason isn´t really that there are more policemen than anywhere else in Panama, although I have to say we have a strong police force presence, but the small town scale that makes everyone behave better. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now, if it makes you feel better, Casco Antiguo has 3 different types of police forces. Why? because this used to be Panama&#8230;. the entire city of Panama. So we ended up with the Presidential Police (or SPI), the National Police Station and now the Tourism Police. Although they all take their jobs very seriously, my own &#8220;town-like&#8221; view of the difference between station and station is the following:</p>
<p>The Presidential Police are tall guys standing in B Avenue by the Presidential Compound, mostly strong and good looking. They also like flirting a lot with the girls passing by, so don´t take it personally, they do it with everybody. It is part of the &#8220;latino thing&#8221; they have going on. Remember our last President was a woman, I´m sure she picked them personally. Good taste in most cases!</p>
<p>The Tourism Police are the &#8220;tropical nice guys&#8221; of the town. Wearing tight shorts, they run around in bicycles and they can give you a tour of Casco Viejo. Somehow the government thought it was useful (or fun?) to have policemen be tour guides. Well&#8230; but they are very helpful, basically they are the true neighborhood police.  If you get lost or need to go anywhere, they´ll do their best to point you out in the right direction.</p>
<p>The National Police is more of a &#8220;normal&#8221; police in the sense that they direct traffic and handle crime cases.  Most of them remind me of the classic police image of the guy with a belly and a donut, but they really want to help and do their work.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So there you go! the best part is to see them training. Of course, the SPI trains like hell, starting at 5 a.m. in the morning, running through the streets of Casco singing songs and doing some serious gymnastics. The tourism police (see picture below) does some exercise and participate in football leagues. The National Police&#8230; well, haven’t seen them doing much physical training at all!<br />

<p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:'Courier New';">There is a silent neighbor in the old city, one that has been shadowed by the gorgeous historic architecture and taken for granted by most of us, but they lighten up with the first rains of March in an explosion of flowers and make our daily lives better in very subtle ways. These ignored neighbors have a memory and rhythm of their own, and they are a vital part of Casco’s identity. With all the world’s climate issues, we would like to take this opportunity to get everyone thinking about a more sustainable Casco, an example to the rest of Panama City. The seeds are already getting planted&#8230; join us!<span>  </span></span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:'Courier New';"><br />

<p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:'Courier New';">Here is the challenge: design a cheap, easy to build and good looking composting system (yes, we have to look good at all times). The winner will win not only a $100, but a place in our hearts but in our balconies and terraces. <span> </span>The winning design will be used in a program in Casco Viejo to help build and sustain several organic gardens that will provide both good food and awareness about recycling. The rules of the contest are very simple and it is open to everyone, either living in Casco or not.</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:'Courier New';">To download the info, just click here: http://www.arcoproperties.com/images/Urbanposterfinal.jpg</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:'Courier New';">Or go to my homepage: <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">www.arcoproperties.com</a>.

I have to say I was pretty impressed by the organization, especially in Panama! if you don´t know them yet, check out their website: http://www.quintessentially.com/index.php?lang=PA </p>

<p>It was a white linen extravaganza, so everyone had to show up in white. It was easy for me, but I know of someone that had to wear his judo pants&#8230; Well, no one noticed and I´m sure he was not the only one. The party started at the bouganvillea walk (Paseo Hurtado), with a romantic carpet of rose petals that led the way. Once at the point of Las Bóvedas there were several stands, massage from Alta Vita Spa,  a Real Estate one (of course!) strategically located in front of the Tequila (by Patron) bar where you could get sunrise tequila with or without the sunny part.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="152" src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/web%20Casco%20Antiguo%20couple.JPG" height="204" /><img border="0" width="242" src="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/content/binary/Web%20Casco%20Antiguo%20massage%20Alta%20Vita.JPG" height="181" />   </p>
<p>There was a great, relaxed, ambiance, everyone enjoyed themselves. The night was perfect, good ocean breeze. After a while we walked down to Plaza Francia. They organized a swimsuit fashion show with 14 top colombian models coming out of a Jaguar car. Quite fancy! Finally, we ended up at Las Bovedas bar which made the perfect lounge to ask for more drinks non tequila related.</p>

It was last updated at 11:00 on March 25 2008.</span><span>&lt;!&#8211;[if !vml]&#8211;&gt;<img border="0" width="460" src="/DOCUME~1/CONSER~1.A/CONFIG~1/Temp/msohtml1/01/clip_image001.jpg" alt="Vicky Baker" height="276" />&lt;!&#8211;[endif]&#8211;&gt;</span><span>Open to the skies: Casco Viejo, Panama City. Photograph: Vicky Baker</span><span>By the time travellers hear about the hip new part of town in a foreign city, it&#8217;s usually too late. We might think we&#8217;re cutting edge as we sip a cocktail in Berlin&#8217;s Prenzlauer Berg, Buenos Aires&#8217; Palermo or Brooklyn&#8217;s Williamsburg, but the locals will have long been bemoaning the inflated prices and reminiscing about the good old days.</span><span>If you&#8217;re looking to get ahead of the game, Panama City&#8217;s Casco Viejo is as up-and-coming as it gets. Situated in the city&#8217;s far west, with a waterside location looking across to the imposing downtown skyscrapers, it&#8217;s a ramshackle maze of dimly lit residential streets and tumbledown colonial buildings. </span><span>Sometimes compared with the French Quarter of New Orleans, there&#8217;s a faded romance to its townhouses, with their wrought-iron balconies and long, wood shutters. Although intimidating at first glance (and locals will advise you to avoid the so-called zona rojas – red light districts – such as neighboring Chorrillo), the area becomes endlessly beguiling on closer inspection. An occasional art deco edifice catches you by surprise. As does seeing the sky in places you shouldn&#8217;t; the hollow insides of many buildings enabling you to look right through them.</span><span>A slum during the 1980s Noriega dictatorship, the area has been touted as ripe for regeneration for years. Although work began in the 90s, a wavering national economy meant it got off the ground in fits and starts. Now, as the country experiences its biggest-ever boom, project Casco Viejo &#8211; or Casco Antiguo, as the area is officially, though less commonly known &#8211; is accelerating an astounding pace. &#8220;Under construction&#8221; signs can be found at every turn and the streets echo to the sound of hammering, day and night. </span><a name="&amp;lid={inArticleElement}{Casco_Viejo,_Pan"></a><span class="inline"><span><span><span style="color:blue;">&lt;!&#8211;[if !vml]&#8211;&gt;<img border="0" width="220" src="/DOCUME~1/CONSER~1.A/CONFIG~1/Temp/msohtml1/01/clip_image002.jpg" alt="Vicky Baker" height="130" />&lt;!&#8211;[endif]&#8211;&gt;</span></span></span></span><span></span><span class="caption1"><span>A street</span></span><span class="caption1"><span> in Casco Viejo </span></span><span>It&#8217;s the regeneration&#8217;s faltering beginnings that make such an unusual picture today. Casco Viejo has become a strange hybrid where suddenly, out of the ruins, you find a perfectly renovated plaza, or an ice-cream <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=e8a1073d-fb5d-43b1-8d36-d1a6574dcd5b&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.granclement.com%2f">shop</a> that with a vintage scoop collection and pretentious flavours (basil, rosemary, Earl Grey tea) that wouldn&#8217;t look out of place in Islington (neither, at £3.80 for two scoops, would its prices). </span><span>Inevitably, real-estate opportunists spotted the potential here long ago. Buildings that could have been snapped up for $70,000 (£35,265) a few years ago are now going for $700,000 (£352,656). But, as the predominantly foreign investors move in, what about the current residents? </span><span>&#8220;Where else can the poor have sea views like here?&#8221; says Eugenio, a former cargo-boat chef, looking towards the Panamanian Gulf. &#8220;This building where I live is worth $600,000 (£302,274) to a developer now,&#8221; he adds, tapping the peeling paint. Unfortunately for him, he&#8217;s not the owner. Every person that passes by may wave or shout his name, but, like many residents, he is likely to be forced out soon. &#8220;I&#8217;m expecting to move,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t know when or where.&#8221;</span><span>Eugenio&#8217;s future may be unsure, but Casco Viejo&#8217;s is sealed. Next year the five-star <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=e8a1073d-fb5d-43b1-8d36-d1a6574dcd5b&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hotelcascoantiguo.com%2f">Hotel Casco Antiguo</a> will open its doors, and a new breed of tourist will soon be walking its brick-lined streets. Those looking to understand where it&#8217;s coming from and where it&#8217;s going to should catch it now. For better or worse, Casco Viejo is certainly one to watch.</span></p>

<p>Nothing like art and culture to open a dialogue and change society.  The current initiative by Panama´s Chapter of International Transparency paralel to the current International Anti Corruption Conference being held is simply genius (and of course we love it is happening in Casco´s plazas, so full of symbolism and open for free to everyone).</p>
<p>Started November 29th and will continue until the 4th of December, mainly showing at Plaza Catedral, but the 3rd at Plaza Francia. 6:30 p.m.  Each night, a different movie, from Panama, Mexico and so many others, all with the same running theme, different angles. Each one an excellent piece.  I caught the one about the Dietilene Glycol case and it was painful, but also a story of courage and love.</p>
<p>More about the conference <a href="http://iaccseries.org/">HERE</a></p>
<p>More on the films <a href="http://www.ecocinema.net/">HERE</a></p>
<p>Here are the movies being shown:</p>

<p>Saturday night at Casco Antiguo is fun. Fridays you may hit or miss, Sundays are quite &#8220;tranquilo&#8221;, but Saturdays are great.  Last night we went to have a bite to eat at Plaza Bolivar and on our way we heard Platea booming with music live. After dinner we went to Plaza Herrera to visit &#8220;Raffa&#8221; at our favorite (and only) heavy metal bar and it was packed with a fantastic rock band live.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Saturday night at Casco Antiguo is fun. Fridays you may hit or miss, Sundays are quite &#8220;tranquilo&#8221;, but Saturdays are great.&nbsp; Last night we went to have a bite to eat at Plaza Bolivar and on our way we heard Platea booming with music live. After dinner we went to Plaza Herrera to visit &#8220;Raffa&#8221; at our favorite (and only) heavy metal bar and it was packed with a fantastic rock band live. A sign with &#8220;Welcome&#8221; written in six different languages gave away the young international crowd that was at the place having fun side by side with locals. </p>
<p>Next door, at the former Pension Herrera, there was another party spot, this time<br />
latin salsa. Outside their doors a woman was cooking &#8220;carne en palito&#8221; (a classic<br />
Panamanian grab &amp; go for carnivals and parties in general) and other life-saving-after-many-beers<br />
food. She knows her market well.</p>
<p>Then you continue walking and the party extends to La Casona de Brujas, the No.1 bohemian<br />
spot in the city. They had an art show going on which &#8211; of course &#8211; leads you to the<br />
open courtyard and bar, which anyways you may want to visit first if you want to trully<br />
grasp the meaning of the show.</p>
<p>We had a blast. The best (for me and my very weird sense of humor) was Beethoven,<br />
Raffa´s dog. Everyone knows Beethoven. He is the only true punk-heavy metal dog I<br />
know who can sleep right next to the amplifier and when the song stops&#8230; he wakes<br />
up, runs out the bar, barks, barks, and comes back to sleep again during another song.</p>
<p>As I´ve always said, Casco Viejo is all about uniqueness and authenticity&#8230; in every<br />
sense!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Apparently there was a &#8220;Women´s Day&#8221; last week. I wonder if there is a &#8220;Man´s Day&#8221; at some point other than Father´s Day, since there is ceirtainly a &#8220;Children´s Day&#8221; (at least in Panama) on top of other holidays. The good part of actually getting a day named with a theme (other than selling more of the corresponding merchandise) is that some people actually takes the time to think seriously about it and create true awareness about the issue.</p>
<p>Yesterday I passed by Casa Gongora in Casco Antiguo, right at the corner between Central Avenue and Fourth Street, because they had an art exhibition celebrating Women´s Day. I found out the event was about much more, including music concerts (Bolero and Jazz), poetry reading, painting exhibitions and TV shows. All of this organized by the Municipality. The exhibition is called Art and Women: Political and Social Participation.</p>
<p>I took some pictures of the paintings of Marta Sanchez, Marta Noemi Noriega and others. There where several artists invited, the exhibition will be there until March 28th.</p>
<p>Here is the calendar of events, if you happen to stroll by Casa Gongora:</p>
<p>March 19th: Jazz Quartet</p>
<div style="width:229px;" class="photo_style_inline_left"><a href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/2091088.html" class="ptl"><img width="225" src="http://img6.travelblog.org/Photos/56385/256397/t/2091088-Black-Heritage-0.jpg" alt="Black Heritage" height="300" style="border:medium none;" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/2091088.html" class="ptl"><b>Black Heritage</b></a></div>
<p>, 8 p.m.<br />
Until March 28th: painting exhibition<br />
March 28: Bolero night with Yomira John 8 p.m.<br />
TV Show: March 13th (I guess it´s too late now!) with Rosa M. Britton<br />
March 27th: Poetry Readings and Event Closing 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the paintings! here are my favorites. If you like my postings on Casco and would love to learn more, don´t forget to download my Casco Antiguo Handbook at: http://www.arcoproperties.com</p>

<p>Graffiti art draws attention. This is a plain fact. Passing by a street, suddenly, a well done (or badly done) graffiti is on the wall and you can´t help but see it. For some (if it is a well done graffiti) and only for a micro second, a smile curves the very corner of their lips. For them, there is something about that wild expression of street rebelion that appeals to their skin. Maybe something they already thought about and never dared to speak and are glad someone else took the chance to &#8220;scream&#8221; about it visually on a public surface.</p>
<p>For others, is an attempt to public and private property, and specially if the graffiti is badly done, a monument to bad taste that should be wiped out, properly cleaned by those vandals.</p>
<p>And this reaction is exactly the point of Graffiti.  This word comes from the Italian word Graffiato. Some track it back to the Greeks, Graphein, which means to write. But I like Graffiato better, as it means &#8220;scratched&#8221;. To produce works of art by scratching a design into a surface. That scratch produces another one in our own sensibilities, makes us think for a moment, meditate about it.</p>
<p>What very few know, myself included until read in Wikipedia, is that the Romans used graffiti on walls and monuments all throughout the Empire. Because many were preserved by the eruption of the Vesuvius they help us understand how was the  the real roman citizens lived (not at the high level of their governants or the history gloriously passed on books) but down to the street level. What was it like. There were graffitis of all sorts, from magic spells to famous literary quotes. From Political slogans and caricatures to the address of brothels.</p>
<p>But apparently they weren´t the only ones scratching their walls, in America, the Mayans also did their share in Tikal. There are examples in many other cultures and places like the Vikings all the way down to Constantinople.</p>
<p>Why? because in the words of Terrace Lindall &#8220;People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls &#8211; It´s free&#8230;&#8221;.  On the same token, she points out &#8221; However, people also have a right to protect their property. it is a human dilemma.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, everyone associates Graffiti with hip hop culture. But this was only after the 60´s. Artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat used this technique and brought it to the formal art world, where it hasn´t left ever since. After all, art and well done anti-stablishment understand each other very well!  The art has evolved and depending &#8211; of course &#8211; of the artist it might still &#8220;scratch&#8221; our surface with an interesting/controversial subject or not. Some graffiti are purely abstract, a use of their technique per se. Or maybe just to force us out of our real world for a second and look into some wild vision of their own imaginarium.</p>
<p>In the heavily regulated external skin of Casco Viejo there is little space for this rebelious behavior. But inside it&#8230; surprises may pop up! check the artists out at: Ripo + Above :  <a href="http://southcentraltour.wordpress.com/">http://southcentraltour.wordpress.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>I just got the last issue of THE VISITOR/ EL VISITANTE ( http://www.thevisitorpanama.com/) and to my great suprise it features Avenida Central, one of my favorite places in Casco Antiguo. The issue is printed, they take a few days to upload the article to their website, so here it is&#8230; hot from the press.</p>
<p>Section: Shopping with Patra Kastanopoulos</p>
<h1><b>I wronged you! Avenida Central</b></h1>
<p>All I actually knew about the pedestrian mall on Avenida Central was &#8220;Don´t take anything valuable there!&#8221;. So I avoided going. I´m ashamed, embarrassed, and am making amends. The day I visited I was enchanted with the extensive array of interesting shops and stores, the helful and amenable people who worked in them, and the mellow, mostly Panamanian shoppers, who filled the area. Never did I feel anything but joy as I trod this unique section that is the &#8220;real&#8221; Panama City. One can see and feel the culture with all one´s senses. Intriguing aromas waft into the nostrils, vivid colors hit the retina, music floods the ears, fabrics for sale are beckoning to be touched and taste sensations are available to explode upon the tongue. And then, there are the bargains!</p>
<p>Merchandise of every genre is plentiful at a cost to fit small budgets. People really buy here, not just browse like in many upscale malls. Everyone seemed to be toting several sacks of purchases and I mused about which items rested within. Produce? there are multiple stands selling fresh fruits and veggies. Yard goods= I´m not clever enough to sew on a button straight, but for thsoe who are gifted in seamstressing there exists a wonderland of every conceivable fabric available at very low cost. i saw bolts of cloth bearing signs for lenghts at under $1.00. Perfume shops are everywhere, but beware, some of the recognizable brands are actually fakes. Jewelry stores are also in abundance and I smiled when I saw the sign HAWAII, my former home, identifying one of them.</p>
<p>At the 3.story El Machetazo I discovered a huge, vinyl, zippered, carry bag for only $1.98. What I liked about it was that the design was a tasteful Scotch plaid as opposed to similar bags displaying Winnie the Pooh or Barbie. (Or worse!).</p>
<p>The American Outleat features gently used clothing at rock bottom prices. I gravitated to it like I was being beamed there by radar.</p>
<p>Army Force combines camping equipment, &#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Last Tuesday was the first Panama Edition of Slideluck Postshow Panama. For those who didn´t read my prior posting, this event had a great concept: basically everyone could show up with something cooked by themselves to share with others while a super slideshow of different Panamanian and international artists played. Sounds wacky, but it was great. We had a fantastic crowd and no less than 20 artists from Brazil to Panama showing spectacular stuff, mainly photography and painting.</p>
<p>Of course, I was not one of the artists, since I´m not the best photographer in the world. Actually, my camera decided not to work, so I´m posting one that Casey kindly sent us.</p>
<p>The good news is that the event was so sucessful that they´ll work now on a second edition! Slideluck Potshow will soon upload all the info and pictures of the event in their website: http://slideluckpotshow.com/panama.php </p>

Actually, the current Panama Female Champion, Samantha, taught herself how to surf on this wave. A neighbour right next door to us, she is a firecracker.  Today, she competes internationally, her last competition was in Chile earlier this year.  Made it to the top 13, her biggest challenge being the water temperature&#8230; we have such nice warm waters!</p>
<p> Here are two pictures, one of her surfing alone and the other one is the wave taken yesterday in Casco Viejo at Las Bovedas Point.  Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>This is one of the things I enjoy most of living in Casco Viejo: there is always  an interesting cultural event going on. Last sunday it was Drum Fest&#8230; a loud  but very enjoyable (somehow) event where hearts pumped at the drums of all sorts  of musicians. Preparing for Jazz Fest? (remember its from January 21th to 26th) probably! but I´m also glad that drums  where taken in consideration seriously enough to have it´s own place. For me,  Panamanian drums are one of the best places to look for fusion between cultures.  Why? because Panama is a complete blend between spanish, caribbean, african and  indigenous&#8230; and you can feel it in how we play the drum.</p>
<p>The other day  I was thinking about it when I attended a dinner at this place called &#8220;Tinajas&#8221;  which is a famous restaurant in Panama because of it´s traditional dance show  with polleras and montunos. This is our best known heritage, from the central  part of the country, where the Spanish had their biggest cultural influence.  Folkloric music from this area is played with flute, violin (almost extinct now  replaced by the cheerful but also loud achordeon), guitar and drums. While the  dancing was very &#8220;spanish colonial&#8221; and the dresses could very well ressemble a  court dance, the drums, once left alone &#8230; where definatly african. Wild drums,  wild rythms, a joyful smile in the drummers&#8230; in which faces you could see  clearly traces of both spanish and indians. What a world! and all in Panama.</p>
<p>So even if it´s loud, I like drums. And I think it suits Casco Viejo  perfectly, since the old town itself blends all sorts of architectural styles,  ranging from colonial to republican but not forgetting caribbean and art deco.  What a wild place!</p>

<p>For Panama, here is the summary:</p>
<p>In 2007, Panamanian economy grew 9.5%. This is Panama´s 4th year of sustained growth where the GNP per person has incremented 7.7%.</p>
<p>For 2008 they are more conservative: estimating an 8.5% growth, still 1% more than what they estimated at the beginning for 2007 which was 7%.  They estimate that the public deficit will remain less than 1% of the GNP.</p>
<p>During 2007 public debt was reduced (from 61% to 54%) and public investment increased in programs related to reduce poverty and to moderate the impact of inflation over basic goods.  It was also the year where the canal expansion was authorized, an important construction that will be done between 2007 and 2012 with investments that would be equivalent of 25% of 2007´s GNP.  Unemployment was reduced from 8.7% (in 2006) to 6.3%.  Exports at the Colon Free Trade Zone increased in 15%.  Local products like melon, watermelon and pineapple increased 11%.</p>
<p>Tourist visitors increased 16% and their expense raised another 14%.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><span class="uhora_tnoticia">Is Panama on its way to become the new Hong Kong of Latin America? a wild thought, and quite unthinkable ten years ago&#8230; but not all that crazy these days. Think about it: all the companies that are moving their headquarters here (Caterpillar, Procter &amp; Gamble, Dell between others), the international banking center along with the Free Trade Zone are paving the way. The Canal Expansion alone is generating masive amount of business, but ironically it is only one of many other indicators that are either at the same volume or more. A well balanced economy, in the middle of the America´s Continent. It´s rapidly becoming the best hub to access the region.</p>
<p>At the beginnings of 2007 every international and national analyst thought Panama was going to grow between 7% to 8%. They were already impressed by the steady growth in past years: 2006 surpassed most economic indicators from the last 14 years. But 2007 proved to be so much better than expected. Here is an article from La Prensa, with a quick analysis on the regional growth, from Argentina to Bahamas.</p>
<p>http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2007/12/13/uhora/negoc_2007121311303416.shtml</p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="uhora_texto"><span class="uhora_time">11:30 a.m. &#8211; </span><span class="uhora_texto">CHILE (EFE). -La economía de América Latina y el Caribe creció  un 5.6% en 2007, con lo que completó cinco años consecutivos de expansión, según  un Balance Preliminar presentado hoy en Santiago por la CEPAL.</p>
<p>Panamá,  con un 9.5%; Argentina, con un 8.6%; Venezuela, con un 8.5%, y Perú, con un  8.2%, lideraron el crecimiento a nivel de países, mientras en el extremo  inferior de la escala se situaron Nicaragua (3%), Ecuador (2.7%), Jamaica (1.5%)  y Dominica (1.0%).</p>
<p>También con altos niveles de expansión figuran  República Dominicana (7.5%), Uruguay (7.5%), Colombia (7.0%), Costa Rica (7.0%)  y Cuba (7.0%), mientras Honduras creció un 6% y Paraguay y Guatemala lo hicieron  un 5.5%, según el texto.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Last night I was sitting in a beautifully restored 300 year old church listening to sacred and Christmas music in a concert given by Musica Viva, a very well known Panamanian choir. It took me 6 minutes to walk from my office to the concert, which lasted an hour, and another 10 minutes to walk back home (I was so sleepy I was walking slowly).  No fuss, no traffic, and a great event in a unique hidden jewel of a colonial city. While sitting there, relaxing to the tones of Bach, Mozart and Scarlatti and humming cheerfully with Handel´s best seller (Hallelujah) I thought to myself: I´m so spoiled now! the world has only a few places where you can live this, all of them very special and in high demand. I feel so lucky to be here and live the revitalization of this wonderful town.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>What does this mean for Panama? a huge change culturally and economically.</p>
<p>Panama has the amazing good fortune of having oceans to both sides of the country. However, when the main capital of the country grew in population and houses, infrastructure was left aside.  In time, pollution of the bay, one of our finest beaches and entertainment sites became so common that we decided to forget about it and continue to grow with our backs towards the ocean.</p>
<p>In recent years the population gained concience of this important problem and  have been lobbying government after government a way to re gain green areas and to clean the bay. Finally a master plan was approved, and slowly works have started.  Today,  great news came out in the papers: Panama got a 40 million financing to clean the bay. Didn´t even make it to the first page, but its positive impact is far more important than any of those news on the cover: a clean beach in the middle of the city. This alone has been the key for success in many other countries. Not to mention Miami Beach, our closest example. Keep in mind that according to the official news Panama grew 11.3% on it´s last trimester. Imagine the city with a great beach&#8230;! there´s even a surfable wave out there that only the very adventurous know about.</p>
<p>And what does this mean for Casco Viejo? very few remember the Casco is surrounded by water and small pockets of beaches. Even today, it is possible to spend  lazy sunday afternoons at one of them&#8230; just don´t get in the water&#8230; All this will change soon. Imagine, not only living in a colonial city 5 minutes away from a cosmopolitan modern city, but having beaches walking distance from your home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>I often comment on my clients that Casco Antiguo is like Woody Allen: either you hate it or you love it, there is no &#8220;in between&#8221;. It is definatly not for everyone. For the right person, it is very easy to fall in love with it on their first visit. They get the same feeling as a kid walking into a store with tons of candy, wide smile on their faces, dreams about their restored home.  But&#8230; hey! wake up! it takes some serious work and personal honesty to go further this point and succeed.</p>
<p>If you decide to get serious, there are some things you need to get very honest with yourself and draw your own limits.  You might still be open to several options, but you need to slowly get down to earth with the type of property you can would be happy with and can afford.</p>
<p>Step one: read our handbook. It´s free, and gives you a lot of background.</p>
<p>Step two: define your goals. Do you want a home for yourself? do you want to restore (recommended for people with construction or similar background that are willing to spend a lot of time and energy on the ground) or do you want to have an apartment? Are you planning to live here or have a vacation home? How much are you willing to spend?</p>
<p>Now: big note here. Answers like: &#8220;it depends on the property&#8221; are missleading. It is not honest nor with yourself nor with the realtor. Of course it depends on the property. What you need to be clear and let others know is how high are you willing to go for your &#8220;Super Non Plus Ultra Ideal Property&#8221;.</p>
<p>So really sit down and calculate a number. Don´t be afraid of telling the realtor what this number is. They will be dead honest with you and tell you straight up if there is anything for you out there that matches your desire and budget.</p>
<p>If you are thinking on restoring a ruin, then keep in mind you will need enough funding for purchasing and construction. Financing is available, but it will heavily depend on your own credit. You need to have at least 30% of the cash on your side to restore + the purchase of the land.</p>
<p>Step three: Walk the Casco. At day, at night. Feel it. Breathe it. Get used to its rythms. There is no point in buying blindly. This is a special place and buying is a big decision. Rent a short term rental apartment and take your time.</p>
<p>Step four: Get a good, specialized realtor. Yes, well, that´s a no brainer for me, since this is all I do 24/7, but I have my reasons to strongly suggest going with a professional: they have far more information and far deeper understanding about the area and it´s dinamic. It is just that simple. You can try and run around yourself, but it will take you a long time to find something you like and will loose a lot of resources in the way. You will loose opportunities and grow grey hair.</p>
<p>Step five: Get a good lawyer.  Don´t go cheap on this. Get a good lawyer. You might want to visit some banks in case you go foward, it is easier to open a bank account.</p>
<p>Step six: understand the process. A good realtor and lawyer can explain how things work. Be patient. Casco is a sellers market at the moment, so it takes quite some patience and you need to be prepared to go with asking price.</p>
<p>Step seven: work on your ideal situation until you narrow it down to concrete, existing options. Then you can &#8220;pull the trigger&#8221; and get your property!!!</p>
<p>Good luck!!!  and by the way, don´t forget to check out my website if you want to learn more about Casco Viejo:  www.arcoproperties.com</p>

Somehow I realized there is no guide with all the contacts of Restaurants, Bars and other businesses in the Casco, so here it goes:</p>
<p>Restaurants:</p>
<p>Ego &amp; Narciso: One beside the other at Plaza Bolivar. Wonderful peruvian tapas at Ego and very good italian food at Narciso. You can order from both, no problem! the owner is thinking on opening a third one in the same plaza&#8230; so coming soon!  262-2045</p>
<p>CasaBlanca: casual dinning at Plaza Bolivar. 212-0040</p>
<p>Platea &amp; Scena: Scena is a nice formal restaurant above Platea which is our favorite jazz bar. They also have live music most nights, ranging from salsa to rock. Located on Calle 1era, in front of the old Club Union.  228-4011</p>
<p>Casuale: great mix of Argentinian food in two ambiances: formal and lounge. Location: Calle 1era&#8230; at the side of Arco Properties! (place commercial here&#8230; =)   228-1017</p>
<p>Buzios: Brazilian inspired, meditarrenean food. Relaxed ambiance, outside seating, ocean view. Location: Calle 1era, at the side of the French Embassy. 228-9045</p>

<p>Café René: Tapas restaurant, informal. Location: Plaza Catedral, at the side of the church. 262-3487</p>
<p>Las Bóvedas Restaurant: because it´s set up at two of the vaults of Plaza Francia, its interesting to see the interior. Sometimes they have live music. Location: Plaza Francia. 228-8058</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal"><span> If I stop to think about it seriously, I would probably come back again and again to the same feature: diversity.</p>
<p>This simple word, more than any complicated concept defines Panama. Diversity plus being a happy &#8211; non violent country is what makes us so special. Everything else traces back to those two/three things.</p>
<p>Natural and geographic diversity. Diversity of races, cultures, languages, there is no single Panamanian in the entire country that doesn’t have inside his veins blood samples from all around the world. Not even the indigenous cultures are 100% originally from Panama, since studies already tell us they all came from either the north or the south. According to research done by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama was the last piece to emerge in Central America,  joinning the two continents for the good of all human kind (not an exaggeration, research appoints that it was this barrier that allowed Europe to have warm waters and to develop). So the first group of people to show up came 11,000 years ago. Meaning.. no one is really from here&#8230; but all our ancestors came motivated by either beauty, convenience or business (or combinations of all three) which are just about the best reasons to come to a country and make it happen.</p>
<p>Everything in a Panamanian screams diversity: we eat &#8220;saus&#8221;, fried fish with patacones (with ajichombo sauce, very Caribbean food), almojábanos (spanish food), tortillas and chicheme (indigenous food). We dance salsa and reggae (again, caribbean culture) and when we are tired there is nothing better than a hammock (which is an indigenous tradition that the spanish reported as &#8220;evil&#8221; back in the colonial days because it promoted &#8220;laziness&#8221;). Any kid in the street has innate rhythm that can turn any plastic tank into a display of drums that make your heart beat. Our folkloric music includes both violin and drums and our folkloric dresses are influenced by both Europe and Africa. The list goes on and on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Also that’s the reason why Casco Antiguo is such a special place: it was and continues to be the witness of all that mix, each home in a different architectural style (French, Republican, Spanish, Caribbean… even Chinese!), and it’s the main reason why UNESCO decided to protect it: very few historic cities are such a great showpiece for a country’s true identity. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So let’s toast not only to Panama’s 104 years of republican diversity, but also to the more than 11,000 years of cultural mix, and to the at least 3.5 million years of keeping the great American continent together. <span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span> </span></span>Happy Birthday Panama!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Back in the day, Hotel Central used to be one of the most elegant hotels in Casco Antiguo. This beautiful building dominates Plaza Catedral, occupying almost half of a block. As Casco Viejo had it´s ups and downs, the hotel slowly lost it´s chic clientele and was thrown into oblivion for the last 20 years (or more!).  Back in 1995 you could get a room there for $8 a night.</p>
<p>I visited several times during 1995/96. At that time, it was barely operating, later on it was shut down and put on the market for sale. Although run down and forgotten, it never lost it´s charm. Stepping inside that old style lobby opening to a wide foyer (full 4 story ceiling height) was quite an experince.  The wooden balconies overlooking the lobby, the wood furniture at the reception and the misterious map carved on the wall with fading blue and green colors all over it. You could almost see the ghosts of gentlemen walking around on white tuxedos and smoking cigars, taking their hats off to salute ladies with long skirts and umbrellas getting ready for a stroll.</p>
<p>On the ground level it had a couple of commercial spaces and an original iron door elevator (European style). Most rooms had to use the common bathroom facilites, but the suites were luxurious&#8230; they had their own bathroom inside the room! a brand new concept. Going up the stairs you reached the roof terrace. Beautiful views from the back, but unexpected treasures could be found: there where thousands of original roof tiles just dropped there to rot. Back then, each tile was different, each one had an embossed seal from the company that made it. Each one unique. Some where in the shape of bees, others with the names of the makers.</p>
<p>Finally, this year, a hotel brand got hold of it and has started to restore. The site looks like a war zone right now, but just like plastic surgery, it always looks bad before looking good again! Hotels are the key to Casco Antiguo. They create a center of gravity that the neighborhood needs in order to develop commercial life and create value.</p>
<p>Now, more good news: not only one but four sites are about to develop within the next 5 years. Can´t think of a better time and place to either  live ore invest in Casco Viejo!</p>
<p>In the article below you´ll see some information on the project and some pictures taken today while I was walking around. This came out today on a local newspaper: La Estrella de Panama. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Fidel Castro en sus inumerables visitas a Panamá deambuló por sus pasillos y en sus habitaciones disfrutó del sueño y la tranquilidad. En su bar degustó de alguna bebida y del buen sabor de la comida panameña, admiró la esencia de la plaza que nació con la patria, en noviembre de 1903.<br />
Y tal vez conociendo su trayectoria, se hospedó en éste para ser parte de la historia del Gran Hotel Central, que le dio la personalidad de un “Hotel 5 estrellas” en el corazón del Casco Antiguo.<br />
Por 133 años este complejo se posicionó como el hito indiscutible de la historia hotelera panameña y latinoamericana.<br />
Desde su construcción en 1874 fue considerado por diarios como Daily Star &amp; Herald “la verdadera joya arquitectónica” del país, la que deslumbró a extranjeros y que logró seducirlos por su diseño y hospitalidad, convirtiéndolo en el preferido.<br />
El Gran Hotel Central, invaluable joya de la historia panameña volverá a mostrar su mejor cara.<br />
La estructura que preserva la originalidad de sus balcones coloniales y su desgastada elegancia francesa, que conjugan la belleza de una época antigua con el confort del modernismo, sufre en estos momentos una transformación para revivir su época de majestuosidad y brillo.<br />
Volverlo a posicionar como el hotel cinco estrellas de la manzana del Casco Viejo, es el reto de Central Hotel Invesment, consorcio español que lleva a cabo la restauración del edificio que fue testigo de las reuniones de los próceres independentistas, quienes vieron nacer la patria.<br />
Y preservando su autenticidad, el Gran Hotel Central apuesta por recuperar su espacio dentro de la industria hotelera y turística panameña, que le fue privada desde 1997 cuando fue cerrado como albergue de lujo, para entonces convertirse en un sitio de ocasión de bajo nivel.<br />
No fue hasta diciembre del año pasado, que la infraestructura que alojó a prominentes personalidades diplomáticas del siglo XIX como Benjamín Bidlack, John Clayton y Henry Bulwer fue adquirida por inversionistas extranjeros, quienes tendrán la tarea de revivir con brillo la “Fiebre de Oro” de California de 1848, que lo convirtió en el paso obligado hacia Norteamérica.<br />
En esa época estampó su abolengo y riqueza que deslumbró durante más de 100 años a una generación aristocrática.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Every morning (around 8 a.m.) in Casco Viejo, there is a lady who sells home made yogurt door by door. She makes everyone in Arco Properties fight over her delicious goods. So far, she has managed to create a very good, growing business for herself and her family, since she is now &#8220;famous&#8221; in the government and other offices around.</p>
<p>Between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. the &#8220;tamales&#8221; and &#8220;chicheme&#8221; guys pass by. Walking all the way back from Santa Ana and screaming to the top of their lungs&#8230; &#8220;Tamales!!! Sí hay! Calientitos!!!!&#8221;  The tamales guy has a wide range of products: tamales a cuara ($0.25) o a peso ($0.50), plain or with hot sauce. You hear people screaming from the balconies: tamales! tamales!. They sell like hot cakes.  The chicheme vendor is the same story, sometimes he even passes twice a day.</p>
<p>At night, the legendary &#8220;bollo man&#8221; walks in. With almost an operatic range scream, the same story repeats itself. Bollo a cuara! Bollooooo!!!!. He is so emblematic I once had the idea of making a CD called &#8220;The Sounds of Casco Viejo&#8221; and he would be on the first track.</p>
<p>Lunchtime is business time. There is a family that has organized themselves to provide grilled chicken. They are in the corner of Plaza Bolívar, but sometimes they also sell at the corner behind the Cathedral Church. Those guys make serious bucks, the power of an organization. They can cater events, they are a full money making machine.</p>
<p>The stories go on and on&#8230; but all of them have something in common: self motivation. A fire within them burning to change their lives, to improve themselves every day.</p>
<p>For all of us &#8220;new residents&#8221; of Casco Viejo, it is important to take the lead to spread that fire between all the local residents. Our company started last year several programs that have (little by little) started that flame in some. We have a policy of donating 10% of our revenues to an NGO called Calicanto and 5% of our employees time to community work. Last year, this donation was the seed capital to send 20 women of Casco Viejo to Tagua (hotel school), which today are working in different hotels in Panama and would open the doors on the hotels that will soon open in Casco Viejo. It also funded the art school for children at La Casona on Saturdays and even programs with young men providing trainning that enabled them to work in construction or tourism in the Casco. Recently, we donated a year course with the Boy Scouts to 11 kids from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Our new goal for 2008 is creating a Youth Center where we can channel all these activities more efficiently and the community can join efforts.  In our experience, the &#8220;self motivation fire&#8221; must start by educating and caring for the younger kids and their mothers.  It takes so little, and the benefits are long lasting.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>For such a small country, Panama is suddenly surrounded by heavy players. On one hand, the Panama Canal expansion project will cost over $5 billion dollars, and on the other hand, big guys such as Hewlett &#8211; Packard, Caterpillar, the Swiss Sanofi- Aventis, Procter &amp; Gamble and Sinope from China have either expressed their interest of moving headquarters here or are actually doing so.</span></p>
<p>Panama has always benefit from its strategic location but for such a small country and considering the volume of business these group of companies bring together or individually to the table this will have a huge positive repercussion.</p>
<p>Suddenly, airlines that had left the country before such as KLM are flying back to Panama again, re opening direct flights to Amsterdam. Banesco, the Venezuelan bank, has recently jumped into the Panamanian pool, probably looking for safer waters.</p>
<p>Now, what does all this has to do with Casco Antiguo?<br />
<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br />
<!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It so happens that most of these companies are basing in the former Canal  Zone, which is 5 minutes away from Casco Antiguo! Casco Viejo suddenly becomes a wonderful choice for future employees and executives to live in. <span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>A central point between their jobs and modern Panama, they can have it all within a few minutes. It is extremely easy to go back and forth to the Canal Zone, we do it often to go jogging at the Causeway, Administration Building (great “steps” workout!) or to run to the top of Ancon Hill. <span> </span>Back “home” they would have a handful of good lifestyle choices, since some of the best restaurants, café’s, bars and theatres are based in Casco.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p>  <span>Location, location, location!!!  <span></span></span></p>

Everyone has his or her own first memory, or a turning point where they decided to live, work or invest here… Don’t be shy! Take a moment and post your story! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For me, early memories of the Casco are profoundly linked with my family and my childhood. I hope you enjoy the opening of this blog! <span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Patrizia<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>…….</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>November 10th, 2007.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span>It’s a strange experience, to sit here and organize my memories of Casco, trying to remember how it all started for me. Memories are filling the room quickly, running from one corner to the other, clashing and crashing between themselves, competing to be the very first one. It’s all a mix. But I’m pretty sure it started on a Sunday, at an age where my size was the same as the park bench. I can recall this because my favorite thing was to get a “raspado” near Las Bóvedas, and I could barely make it to the top of the pushcart. Raspado Flavor: red with 10 cents of extra condensed milk. I don’t know how I survived to so much sugar. Those family trips were not only fun but fascinating, the Casco was completely in ruins but it was a charmer for any 5 year old, a discovery at every corner. The best of those Sunday trips were the stories. The reason: almost all my family on my father side was either born or raised in Casco back in the 50´s. Walking through the Casco was a window to my father’s childhood, to my grandparent’s youth. I could sense there was a connection, a root I liked and was part of.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span>My “nonnos” (we always called them in the Italian fashion because of my mother who was Italian and because “abuelo” in Spanish sounds like an old person…not my grandparents!!!) lived in the Casco back when it was all Panama had. Remember Panama only turned into a Republic in 1903, my grandparents were born around 1910 (my grandfather), so they lived in the Casco in the 40´s and 50´s. At that time, the Casco was the entire city of Panama, period. <span> </span>They both lived at a side of the current Canal Museum on 6<sup>th</sup> Street and A Avenue, former “Correos y Telégrafos” (Mail and Telegraphy Office, back then the only way to communicate with the rest of Panama and the world) and both worked as Director and Manager at this important office. My father and aunt (Adolfo and tía Isis) where raised in an apartment on the first floor, playing on Plaza Catedral and many other corners of the Casco. So every Sunday visit, my father would point out the house and remember: “and this is the balcony where we lived, and right beside it is the apartment of Doña Laura, the teacher. She used to have a big apartment full of books where we sneaked in to do our homework.” Incredibly enough, Doña Laura is still living there, on the same apartment. She is almost 90 years old now. I met her early this year. When I introduced myself as the daughter of Adolfito, the son of Fina, her eyes glowed and started asking for my aunt, my nonna and everybody. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span>One of the best anecdotes was the shot-on-the-balcony story. It was during one of the three presidencies of Arnulfo Arias Madrid. The military had just carried out their famous coup (1951) and my father must have been 5 years old. At that time my grandmother was actually working at the Presidencial Palace as a secretary (back when there were only six people in the entire Presidential Compound, counting the President) and because of the political unrest she had just quit and was home with the family. There were shooting on the streets and in Calle 6ta were some “rebels” were shooting from the roofs. My grandfather went to the balcony to close the doors and someone shot in his direction. Luckily, the balcony received the bullet. The mark is still there today, as we noticed this past weekend during our Sunday stroll with him. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span>My next clear childhood memory is at the National Theatre. We were at a ballet performance from the National Ballet Company.<span>  </span>Later on, at age 9, I started studying ballet with the National  School, but this memory seems to be prior. The theatre vault and its great surreal painting (by master painter Roberto Lewis) always impressed me. That night I remember clearly it was Gloria Barrios and Andrés Nieto (later on I had the honor to dance on the same stage with them) on a piano piece I later on learned it was Chopin. Andrés was playing the musician while Gloria was his ethereal muse. Going to the Theatre was a fantastic treat and my parents always took my brother and me whenever they had an opportunity.<span>  </span>I would return to this theatre later over and over as a dancer with the National Ballet. For a while it was the headquarters of the company, so I got to be in the Casco every day. So in more than one way, the Casco is full of personal landmarks, some made even before I was born! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span>I hope you had enjoyed my first blog attempt and had encouraged you to write a bit of your own experiences! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p>Here are some pictures for you:<br />

America? a wild thought, and quite unthinkable ten years ago&#8230; but not all that crazy<br />
these days. Think about it: all the companies that are moving their headquarters here<br />
(Caterpillar, Procter &amp; Gamble, Dell between others), the international banking<br />
center along with the Free Trade Zone are paving the way. The Canal Expansion alone<br />
is generating masive amount of business, but ironically it is only one of many other<br />
indicators that are either at the same volume or more. A well balanced economy, in<br />
the middle of the America´s Continent. It´s rapidly becoming the best hub to access<br />
the region.</p>
<p>At the beginnings of 2007 every international and national analyst thought Panama<br />
was going to grow between 7% to 8%. They were already impressed by the steady growth<br />
in past years: 2006 surpassed most economic indicators from the last 14 years. But<br />
2007 proved to be so much better than expected. Here is an article from La Prensa,<br />
with a quick analysis on the regional growth, from Argentina to Bahamas.</p>
<p>http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2007/12/13/uhora/negoc_2007121311303416.shtml</p>

<p class="uhora_texto">
   <span class="uhora_time">11:30 a.m. &#8211; </span><span class="uhora_texto">CHILE (EFE).<br />
   -La economía de América Latina y el Caribe creció un 5.6% en 2007, con lo que completó<br />
   cinco años consecutivos de expansión, según un Balance Preliminar presentado hoy en<br />
   Santiago por la CEPAL.</p>
<p>   Panamá, con un 9.5%; Argentina, con un 8.6%; Venezuela, con un 8.5%, y Perú, con un<br />
   8.2%, lideraron el crecimiento a nivel de países, mientras en el extremo inferior<br />
   de la escala se situaron Nicaragua (3%), Ecuador (2.7%), Jamaica (1.5%) y Dominica<br />
   (1.0%).</p>
<p>   También con altos niveles de expansión figuran República Dominicana (7.5%), Uruguay<br />
   (7.5%), Colombia (7.0%), Costa Rica (7.0%) y Cuba (7.0%), mientras Honduras creció<br />
   un 6% y Paraguay y Guatemala lo hicieron un 5.5%, según el texto.</p>
<p>   Brasil, Chile y Surinam crecieron un 5.3%, en tanto El Salvador lo hizo un 4.5%, lo<br />
   mismo que Guayana, en tanto Bolivia lo hizo un 3.8%.</p>
<p>   México, Haití y Bahamas expandieron su economía un 3.3%, señala el informe de la Comisión<br />

Casco Viejo, San Felipe</p>
<p>Published today at La Prensa: Real Estate: new term ends on December 31st 2009.&nbsp;<br />
This extention was on the eye of a lot of people: both panamanian and foreign. The<br />
former law ended in August 2007, for which the apartment had to have it´s occupation<br />
permits before that date. Otherwise, the property would enter in a chart of lower<br />
incentives, but that still would provide a 5 year exemption for the high end product.&nbsp;<br />
Today´s news is that the government decided to extend the law for project that would<br />
get their occupation permits before December 31st 2009.&nbsp; This would provide the<br />
apartment or new residence a 20 years extention.</p>
<p>Here is the spanish version:</p>

<p>By Guido Bilbao&#8230; This was the opening text for the art exhibition called Greyskull,<br />
the Memoires of a Castle, and I think it´s quite right:</p>
<p>&#8221; San Felipe es un espejo perfecto de Panamá. Todas las contradicciones que enriquecen<br />
y aniquilan las raíces de un país, en este barrio se transfiguran en historias increíbles.<br />
Como la del Castillo Greyskull. Un edificio que atravesó, sintiéndolo en sus paredes,<br />
la historia política y social que nos trajo hasta aquí.</p>
<p>Su historia sigue moviéndose al ritmo pendular de una sociedad que desde su nacimiento<br />
se bambolea entre la riqueza extrema y la marginalidad.</p>
<p>Esta muestra intenta generar espacios de reflexión de este proceso y, sobre todo,<br />
registrar su existencia.&#8221;<br /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Antiguo<br />
Casco Viejo, San Felipe</p>
<p>
Here is an exciting project on the move: transforming Casco Antiguo into an organic<br />
garden. Our friend and organic specialist Spencer Woodard is already working on it,<br />
and I have to say it´s fascinating. I love all green stuff, a tree hugger myself (I<br />
used to work for ANCON and then for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in<br />
Panama, plus all sorts of eco trips I do every now and then) I´m a great fan of turning<br />
anything green, but this friend of ours is really passionate about it.</p>
<p>His idea is to introduce in the parks at the plazas and other forgotten green areas<br />
small, designed, organic gardens. They could have themes as &#8220;exotic plants&#8221; or &#8220;edible<br />
leafs from Central America&#8221; or just serve as community gardens where to teach children<br />
about nature and practical life. Well run, an organic garden could produce enough<br />
to balance the diet of a number of families, so I think it might be a good project<br />
for the local community and a great example for other places to reproduce.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the plants he already has ready. He had &#8220;saril&#8221; which is<br />
a fruit we Panamanians love to use for &#8220;chicha&#8221; on Christmas. I´m not sure why not<br />
the rest of the year, but traditionally this spicy and refreshing drink is only made<br />
in December. He also had a plant where the leaves are rich in Omega 3, for those who<br />
follow the last discoveries in nutrition and health, apparently Omega 3 is important<br />
for your general wellbeing. All grown in a backyard! It could even be arranged for<br />
most of this to grow on a balcony.</p>
<p>In no particular order, here are some shots of his &#8220;vivero&#8221;&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><span lang="EN-US">Panama, Casco Antiguo<br />
Casco Viejo, San Felipe</span></p>
<p>I often comment on my clients that Casco Antiguo is like Woody Allen: either you hate<br />
it or you love it, there is no &#8220;in between&#8221;. It is definatly not for everyone. For<br />
the right person, it is very easy to fall in love with it on their first visit. They<br />
get the same feeling as a kid walking into a store with tons of candy, wide smile<br />
on their faces, dreams about their restored home.&nbsp; But&#8230; hey! wake up! it takes<br />
some serious work and personal honesty to go further this point and succeed.</p>
<p>If you decide to get serious, there are some things you need to get very honest with<br />
yourself and draw your own limits.&nbsp; You might still be open to several options,<br />
but you need to slowly get down to earth with the type of property you can would be<br />
happy with and can afford.</p>
<p>Step one: read our handbook. It´s free, and gives you a lot of background.</p>
<p>Step two: define your goals. Do you want a home for yourself? do you want to restore<br />
(recommended for people with construction or similar background that are willing to<br />
spend a lot of time and energy on the ground) or do you want to have an apartment?<br />
Are you planning to live here or have a vacation home? How much are you willing to<br />
spend?</p>
<p>Now: big note here. Answers like: &#8220;it depends on the property&#8221; are missleading. It<br />
is not honest nor with yourself nor with the realtor. Of course it depends on the<br />
property. What you need to be clear and let others know is how high are you willing<br />
to go for your &#8220;Super Non Plus Ultra Ideal Property&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So really sit down and calculate a number. Don´t be afraid of telling the realtor<br />
what this number is. They will be dead honest with you and tell you straight up if<br />
there is anything for you out there that matches your desire and budget.</p>
<p>If you are thinking on restoring a ruin, then keep in mind you will need enough funding<br />
for purchasing and construction. Financing is available, but it will heavily depend<br />
on your own credit. You need to have at least 30% of the cash on your side to restore<br />
+ the purchase of the land.</p>
<p>Step three: Walk the Casco. At day, at night. Feel it. Breathe it. Get used to its<br />
rythms. There is no point in buying blindly. This is a special place and buying is<br />
a big decision. Rent a short term rental apartment and take your time.</p>
<p>Step four: Get a good, specialized realtor. Yes, well, that´s a no brainer for me,<br />
since this is all I do 24/7, but I have my reasons to strongly suggest going with<br />
a professional: they have far more information and far deeper understanding about<br />
the area and it´s dinamic. It is just that simple. You can try and run around yourself,<br />
but it will take you a long time to find something you like and will loose a lot of<br />
resources in the way. You will loose opportunities and grow grey hair.</p>
<p>Step five: Get a good lawyer.&nbsp; Don´t go cheap on this. Get a good lawyer. You<br />
might want to visit some banks in case you go foward, it is easier to open a bank<br />
account.</p>
<p>Step six: understand the process. A good realtor and lawyer can explain how things<br />
work. Be patient. Casco is a sellers market at the moment, so it takes quite some<br />
patience and you need to be prepared to go with asking price.</p>
<p>Step seven: work on your ideal situation until you narrow it down to concrete, existing<br />
options. Then you can &#8220;pull the trigger&#8221; and get your property!!!</p>
<p>Good luck!!!</p>

<p>   This simple word, more than any complicated concept defines</p>

<p>   Natural and geographic diversity. Diversity of races, cultures, languages, there is<br />
   no single Panamanian in the entire country that doesn’t have inside his veins blood<br />

<p>   , since studies already tell us they all came from either the north or the south.<br />
   According to research done by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,&nbsp;Panama</p>
<p>was the last piece to emerge in Central America,&nbsp; joinning the two continents for the good of all human kind (not an exaggeration,<br />
research appoints that it was this barrier that allowed Europe to have warm<br />
waters and to develop). So the first group of people to show up came 11,000<br />
years ago. Meaning.. no one is really from here&#8230; but all our ancestors came<br />
motivated by either beauty, convenience or business (or combinations of all<br />
three) which are just about the best reasons to come to a country and make it<br />
happen. </p>
<p>         Everything in a Panamanian screams diversity: we eat &#8220;saus&#8221;, fried fish with patacones<br />
         (with ajichombo sauce, very Caribbean food), almojábanos (spanish food), tortillas<br />
         and chicheme (indigenous food). We dance salsa and reggae (again, caribbean culture)<br />
         and when we are tired there is nothing better than a hammock (which is an indigenous<br />
         tradition that the spanish reported as &#8220;evil&#8221; back in the colonial days because it<br />
         promoted &#8220;laziness&#8221;). Any kid in the street has innate rhythm that can turn any plastic<br />
         tank into a display of drums that make your heart beat. Our folkloric music includes<br />
         both violin and drums and our folkloric dresses are influenced by both Europe and<br />
         Africa.<br />
The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>   </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   <span lang="EN-US"></p>
<p>   Also that’s the reason why Casco Antiguo is such a special place: it was and continues<br />
   to be the witness of all that mix, each home in a different architectural style (French,<br />
   Republican, Spanish, Caribbean… even Chinese!), and it’s the main reason why UNESCO<br />
   decided to protect it: very few historic cities are such a great showpiece for a country’s<br />
   true identity.</p>
<p>   </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   <span lang="EN-US">So let’s toast not only to Panama’s 104 years of republican<br />
   diversity, but also to the more than 11,000 years of cultural mix, and to the at least<br />
   3.5 million years of keeping the great American continent together. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>   </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   <span lang="EN-US"><span> </span></span>Happy Birthday Panama!

San Felipe, Casco Viejo</p>
<p>
Back in the day, Hotel Central used to be one of the most elegant hotels in Casco<br />
Antiguo. This beautiful building dominates Plaza Catedral, occupying almost half of<br />
a block. As Casco Viejo had it´s ups and downs, the hotel slowly lost it´s chic clientele<br />
and was thrown into oblivion for the last 20 years (or more!).&nbsp; Back in 1995<br />
you could get a room there for $8 a night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I visited several times during 1995/96. At that time, it was barely operating, later<br />
on it was shut down and put on the market for sale. Although run down and forgotten,<br />
it never lost it´s charm. Stepping inside that old style lobby opening to a wide foyer<br />
(full 4 story ceiling height) was quite an experince.&nbsp; The wooden balconies overlooking<br />
the lobby, the wood furniture at the reception and the misterious map carved on the<br />
wall with fading blue and green colors all over it. You could almost see the ghosts<br />
of gentlemen walking around on white tuxedos and smoking cigars, taking their hats<br />
off to salute ladies with long skirts and umbrellas getting ready for a stroll.</p>
<p>On the ground level it had a couple of commercial spaces and an original iron door<br />
elevator (European style). Most rooms had to use the common bathroom facilites, but<br />
the suites were luxurious&#8230; they had their own bathroom inside the room! a brand<br />
new concept. Going up the stairs you reached the roof terrace. Beautiful views from<br />
the back, but unexpected treasures could be found: there where thousands of original<br />
roof tiles just dropped there to rot. Back then, each tile was different, each one<br />
had an embossed seal from the company that made it. Each one unique. Some where in<br />
the shape of bees, others with the names of the makers.</p>
<p>Finally, this year, a hotel brand got hold of it and has started to restore. The site<br />
looks like a war zone right now, but just like plastic surgery, it always looks bad<br />
before looking good again! Hotels are the key to Casco Antiguo. They create a center<br />
of gravity that the neighborhood needs in order to develop commercial life and create<br />
value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, more good news: not only one but four sites are about to develop within the next<br />
5 years. Can´t think of a better time and place to either&nbsp; live ore invest in<br />
Casco Viejo!</p>
<p>In the article below you´ll see some information on the project and some pictures<br />
taken today while I was walking around. This came out today on a local newspaper:<br />
La Estrella de Panama. Enjoy!</p>

<p>   Fidel Castro en sus inumerables visitas a Panamá deambuló por sus pasillos y en sus<br />
   habitaciones disfrutó del sueño y la tranquilidad. En su bar degustó de alguna bebida<br />
   y del buen sabor de la comida panameña, admiró la esencia de la plaza que nació con<br />
   la patria, en noviembre de 1903.<br />
   <br />
   Y tal vez conociendo su trayectoria, se hospedó en éste para ser parte de la historia<br />
   del Gran Hotel Central, que le dio la personalidad de un “Hotel 5 estrellas” en el<br />
   corazón del Casco Antiguo.<br />
   <br />
   Por 133 años este complejo se posicionó como el hito indiscutible de la historia hotelera<br />
   panameña y latinoamericana.<br />
   <br />
   Desde su construcción en 1874 fue considerado por diarios como Daily Star &amp; Herald<br />
   “la verdadera joya arquitectónica” del país, la que deslumbró a extranjeros y que<br />
   logró seducirlos por su diseño y hospitalidad, convirtiéndolo en el preferido.<br />
   El Gran Hotel Central, invaluable joya de la historia panameña volverá a mostrar su<br />
   mejor cara.<br />
   <br />
   La estructura que preserva la originalidad de sus balcones coloniales y su desgastada<br />
   elegancia francesa, que conjugan la belleza de una época antigua con el confort del<br />
   modernismo, sufre en estos momentos una transformación para revivir su época de majestuosidad<br />
   y brillo.<br />
   <br />
   Volverlo a posicionar como el hotel cinco estrellas de la manzana del Casco Viejo,<br />
   es el reto de Central Hotel Invesment, consorcio español que lleva a cabo la restauración<br />
   del edificio que fue testigo de las reuniones de los próceres independentistas, quienes<br />
   vieron nacer la patria.<br />
   <br />
   Y preservando su autenticidad, el Gran Hotel Central apuesta por recuperar su espacio<br />
   dentro de la industria hotelera y turística panameña, que le fue privada desde 1997<br />
   cuando fue cerrado como albergue de lujo, para entonces convertirse en un sitio de<br />
   ocasión de bajo nivel.<br />
   <br />
   No fue hasta diciembre del año pasado, que la infraestructura que alojó a prominentes<br />
   personalidades diplomáticas del siglo XIX como Benjamín Bidlack, John Clayton y Henry<br />
   Bulwer fue adquirida por inversionistas extranjeros, quienes tendrán la tarea de revivir<br />
   con brillo la “Fiebre de Oro” de California de 1848, que lo convirtió en el paso obligado<br />
   hacia Norteamérica.<br />
   En esa época estampó su abolengo y riqueza que deslumbró durante más de 100 años a<br />
   una generación aristocrática.<br />

Patrizia</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">…….</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
November 10th, 2007.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">It’s a strange experience, to sit here and organize my<br />
memories of Casco, trying to remember how it all started for me. Memories are filling<br />
the room quickly, running from one corner to the other, clashing and crashing between<br />
themselves, competing to be the very first one. It’s all a mix. But I’m pretty sure<br />
it started on a Sunday, at an age where my size was the same as the park bench. I<br />
can recall this because my favorite thing was to get a “raspado” near Las Bóvedas,<br />
and I could barely make it to the top of the pushcart. Raspado Flavor: red with 10<br />
cents of extra condensed milk. I don’t know how I survived to so much sugar. Those<br />
family trips were not only fun but fascinating, the Casco was completely in ruins<br />
but it was a charmer for any 5 year old, a discovery at every corner. The best of<br />
those Sunday trips were the stories. The reason: almost all my family on my father<br />
side was either born or raised in Casco back in the 50´s. Walking through the Casco<br />
was a window to my father’s childhood, to my grandparent’s youth. I could sense there<br />
was a connection, a root I liked and was part of.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">My “nonnos” (we always called them in the Italian fashion<br />
because of my mother who was Italian and because “abuelo” in Spanish sounds like an<br />
old person…not my grandparents!!!) lived in the Casco back when it was all</p>
<p>Panama</p>
<p>had. Remember<br />
Panama<br />
only turned into a Republic in 1903, my grandparents were born around 1910 (my grandfather),<br />
so they lived in the Casco in the 40´s and 50´s. At that time, the Casco was the entire<br />
city of</p>
<p>Panama</p>
<p>, period.  They both lived at a side of the current<br />
Canal<br />
Museum<br />
on</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> Street</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>A Avenue</p>
<p>, former “Correos y Telégrafos” (Mail and Telegraphy Office, back then the only way<br />
to communicate with the rest of</p>
<p>Panama</p>
<p>and the world) and both worked as Director and Manager at this important office. My<br />
father and aunt (Adolfo and tía<br />
Isis<br />
) where raised in an apartment on the first floor, playing on Plaza Catedral and many<br />
other corners of the Casco. So every Sunday visit, my father would point out the house<br />
and remember: “and this is the balcony where we lived, and right beside it is the<br />
apartment of Doña Laura, the teacher. She used to have a big apartment full of books<br />
where we sneaked in to do our homework.” Incredibly enough, Doña Laura is still living<br />
there, on the same apartment. She is almost 90 years old now. I met her early this<br />
year. When I introduced myself as the daughter of Adolfito, the son of Fina, her eyes<br />
glowed and started asking for my aunt, my nonna and everybody.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">One of the best anecdotes was the shot-on-the-balcony<br />
story. It was during one of the three presidencies of Arnulfo Arias Madrid. The military<br />
had just carried out their famous coup (1951) and my father must have been 5 years<br />
old. At that time my grandmother was actually working at the</p>
<p>Presidencial<br />
Palace</p>
<p>as a secretary (back when there were only six people in the entire Presidential Compound,<br />
counting the President) and because of the political unrest she had just quit and<br />
was home with the family. There were shooting on the streets and in Calle 6ta were<br />
some “rebels” were shooting from the roofs. My grandfather went to the balcony to<br />
close the doors and someone shot in his direction. Luckily, the balcony received the<br />
bullet. The mark is still there today, as we noticed this past weekend during our<br />
Sunday stroll with him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">My next clear childhood memory is at the National Theatre.<br />
We were at a ballet performance from the National Ballet Company.  Later<br />
on, at age 9, I started studying ballet with the</p>
<p>National<br />
School</p>
<p>, but this memory seems to be prior. The theatre vault and its great surreal painting<br />
(by master painter Roberto Lewis) always impressed me. That night I remember clearly<br />
it was Gloria Barrios and Andrés Nieto (later on I had the honor to dance on the same<br />
stage with them) on a piano piece I later on learned it was Chopin. Andrés was playing<br />
the musician while Gloria was his ethereal muse. Going to the Theatre was a fantastic<br />
treat and my parents always took my brother and me whenever they had an opportunity.  I<br />
would return to this theatre later over and over as a dancer with the National Ballet.<br />
For a while it was the headquarters of the company, so I got to be in the Casco every<br />
day. So in more than one way, the Casco is full of personal landmarks, some made even<br />
before I was born!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">I hope you had enjoyed my first blog attempt and had encouraged<br />
you to write a bit of your own experiences!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Here are some pictures for you:</p>

<p>Casco has really special retail, but our favorite ones are those who have an impact. Whether they benefit social causes like women empowerment and environment, or they promote young entrepreneurs with great design, truth is shopping in these stores will make your purchase benefit far beyond the person you are giving the gift to.  Most are located on A Avenue, between 3rd and 5th, which will make your experience fun and compact!</p>
<p>Starting at 3rd Street, next to Arco Chato:</p>
<p>Karavan: art from Panama´s Caribbean side and modern Guna indian designs.</p>
<p>Viviendo: One of my favorite places for gifts, not only because of the quality of their handcraft and design but because of the direct effect these sales make on the lives of really remote women who live in the mountains of Panama. Each purchase trully makes a difference. Dyes used come literally, from the jungle that surrounds their homes, browns from the clayish floor in those areas. Give a really special gift from the heart of Panama.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lupa: A window into Panama´s young designers. A place to support young artists: clothing, accesories, art pieces.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Lupa-Casco-Viejo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11590" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Lupa-Casco-Viejo-300x225.jpg" alt="lupa-casco-viejo" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Lupa-Casco-Viejo-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Lupa-Casco-Viejo.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Casco-Viejo-Lupa.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11583" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Casco-Viejo-Lupa-300x225.jpg" alt="casco-viejo-lupa" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Casco-Viejo-Lupa-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Casco-Viejo-Lupa.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Undercover Boots: Rainboots! each one with a different design, supporting a cause. For example, the Golden Frog boots support the Golden Frog project, an effort by the Smithsonian and a coalition of Panamanian and international scientists to save the Golden Frog, which is unique to this country and found no where else. They´ve done an amazing job building a sort of Noah´s Arc for them, and studying the fungus that is killing them. It is said that frogs are an indicator of global health: we need to protect them, and to understand them.</p>

<p>Mahalo: Café and store. They feature Panamanian gourmet products and natural soaps. Brands like El Motete are an effort from food producers to market their products directly.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-new-products.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11593" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-new-products-300x225.jpg" alt="mahalo-new-products" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-new-products-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-new-products-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-casco-viejo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11592" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-casco-viejo-300x225.jpg" alt="mahalo-casco-viejo" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-casco-viejo-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mahalo-casco-viejo-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

<p>No Me Olvides: If you are craving a Cuban style guayabera dress or shirt, this is the place to get it. Corner of A and 4th, right in front of Arco Properties.</p>

<p>Casco Antiguo is my home, a history-steeped peninsula with a fortress at its tip, jutting into Panama Bay with a panoramic view of Panama City’s skyline in one direction, and Isla Tobago in the other.   With its Old Panama atmosphere, its narrow bricked streets and variety of sights, sounds and people, it is an interesting place to study what makes for a happy expat.</p>
<p>As is the case in most places, expats drawn here start with common denominators.  Most apparently, those who come to live in Casco Antiguo are virtually self-defined as eschewing the high-rise or golf club life available a short distance away, which draw their own compatible communities.  This is a lively place, a walk-around neighborhood of plazas and restaurants where rundown and revitalized dwellings of three stories or less co-exist under a United Nations historic preservation designation.   You are not lured into thinking a part of “back home” has been transplanted here, and it does not usually take long for a foreigner to make the “love it or leave it” decision.  Yet while most who elect to stay remain happily, a few become disenchanted.  As I have written before, the question that intrigues me, is why?   Is it the experience or the individual that makes the difference?</p>
<p>On any block in Casco Antiguo, you may see laundry draped over the balcony of a century old dwelling next to a revitalized apartment house required by ordinance to keep its Old City touches, while work is underway on still another.   About thirty restored apartments come on the market each year, most of which are purchased by foreigners, though two hundred or so expats still are just a small percentage of the Casco’s population of some 6000.   My roles as a real estate broker and president of a neighborhood association make me (a Panamanian) constantly cognizant of our neighborhood’s human scale.   As to expats, I come to know almost all of them, hence my  opinions on what makes for a happy transplant.</p>
<p>As a group expats fascinate me, perhaps because I have been surrounded by them all my life: My parents were expats (both to and from Italy), I worked at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama with scientists from around the world, and my husband is from the States.   As individuals, I am endlessly fascinated by expat backgrounds and talents. That little group of two hundred expats in Casco includes renowned scientists, private bankers, day traders, professional writers, energetic entrepreneurs right out of college, a working actor, quite a few globe trotting executives, at least two doctors, a director of a large NGO, the regional head of a famous luxury brand, a yoga instructor…the list goes on.</p>
<p>The great majority are extremely happy and I think that most will tell you that they could never see themselves returning to their home countries.  In a recent survey of United Kingdom Expats, 71 percent said they thought they made the right decision, and I would have to guess that the number is not too different here.</p>
<p>Think about that for a second: accomplished people from big, highly-developed countries relocating to a small “third world” country for lifestyle.  As a realtor, I met many such “successes” by telephone or email when they were first contemplating the move and was able to observe them through the process of deliberating, moving, making friends, becoming part of the community and then, finally, helping others to do the same.</p>
<p>In order to better counsel my clients who often become friends, I have tried to be analytical about what makes for a successful transition from a developed country to a developing country.  In Part I of this article I wrote about things that all of the unhappy expats I have known had in common.  But what about the vast majority who have flourished?  They’ve built businesses, started families, made friends and in some cases fortunes. How do they do it?</p>
<p>No two are exactly alike (and that’s what makes it more art than science), but the four things that I think the happiest expats have in common are that they:</p>
<p>1.   knew what they were seeking,<br />
2.   have good chemistry <em>and </em>are compatible with their new environment,<br />
3.   made an effort to adapt culturally, and<br />
4.   engineered a lifestyle they could not have found at home.</p>
<p><strong>Know Thyself, Know Thy Destination</strong></p>
<p>In Part I I mentioned that often expats fail in transitioning simply because they were not going to be happy anywhere. Whether they understood it or not, they were in essence trying to escape from themselves.  The corollary to that is that most of the happy expats I know understand exactly why they left their home countries.  In many cases there were positive reasons, such as searching for new opportunities, experiencing a new culture, accepting a new job, wanting a more active lifestyle, looking for a more central place to base their business or following a romance.</p>
<p>In other cases they reject certain things they know will be different in their adopted country.  Whether it’s politics, economics or a desire to transcend the “same ole,” these are optimistic people who knew what they wanted in life and proactively looked for it.</p>
<p>I’m always amazed at how much I learn about my own country from new clients who come into my office armed with folders full of facts and figures.  Clearly the information is helpful to making an informed decision, but my question to clients contemplating moving to my neighborhood is always the same: what are YOU looking for? The more specific and clear they are about their own priorities, the more confidence I have in recommending (or not recommending) my country.</p>
<p><strong>Chemistry and Compatibility </strong></p>
<p>In romance, great chemistry often starts through the eyes, but what makes two people truly compatible over the long run is how their personalities fit together;  Same for expats and their adopted countries.</p>
<p>I haven’t met anyone who can sit in a cafe on Casco’s 300-year-old Plaza Bolivar and not fall in love with the beautiful architecture in about the time it takes to down a Mojito. But the ones who have great chemistry with the place notice and appreciate much more subtle things, like the sounds of children playing in the street or the weathered wooden building with it’s peeling paint patina on the far corner or the old wandering salesman who sells hot <em>bollos </em>for .25 cents.  When a person focuses merely on the architecture and tells me how much “potential” the neighborhood has and then asks, “When do you think it will be finished?”, I pretty much know the fit isn’t right for the same reasons that I wouldn’t want my best friend to date someone who took that approach with her.</p>
<p>But beyond the initial chemistry is true compatibility. Every place has a character, an essence, and the more that your personality fits with that character the happier you are going to be there.  If you are a Type A personality who needs everything ordered and a world that jumps at your command, the tropics probably aren’t for you no matter how much you love palm trees. To me the key is to simply take some time to focus on the imperfections of a place and ask yourself if they are deal killers. Easy to say, but until you get beneath the surface you won’t really know what its imperfections are.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural adaptation</strong></p>
<p>As anyone with a successful marriage will tell you, chemistry only takes you so far; at some point, relationships require work.  At the risk of torturing the metaphor, I’d say the same goes for moving abroad, and that in both cases the work you put in is paid back many times over.</p>
<p>You can certainly survive in Panama with zero Spanish, but a 500 word vocabulary makes it so much more fun, and as a bonus, almost everything suddenly gets cheaper!  The curiosity to find out why things <em>are the way they are</em> before jumping to how you think they <em>should be</em> is another great adaptation tool, and one that has the added benefit of getting you into a lot of interesting conversations.  A good attitude which includes curiosity is about all that is required here.</p>
<p><strong>The Well Engineered Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p>Probably the greatest thing that moving abroad allows you to do is engineer a lifestyle that is right for you.  If you move to a place that offers more of the things that are important to you than your home did–say waves if you are a surfer, freedom if you’re a libertarian, or parties if you’re a partier–you’re a long way towards finding happiness.</p>
<p>Lifestyle engineering is a whole topic unto itself and I plan to write another article with case studies of expats who have created unique “cosmotropical lifestyles” in the historic district. One of those case studies will certainly be clients of mine, three friends from California, who started a hotel and quickly figured out that it only took two of them to run it, so at any given time one of them is out on a two month travel. They’ve pretty much seen all of Latin America at this point.  Traveling is their priority and they engineered a unique (and lucrative) lifestyle that would have been impossible for them to create back in California.</p>
<p>The key is prioritizing–the happiest expats I know have their priorities straight and have done the work to organize a lifestyle around those priorities in a way they couldn’t have where they came from.</p>
<p><strong>Love for the underdog</strong></p>
<p>One final thing I’ve noticed about the expats here is that quite a few seem to have a love for the underdog.  I noticed this watching the world cup with a group of them because I was stunned to see that the group favorite was…Ghana?  We Panamanians had been rooting for Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Italy–anyone we thought had a chance of making the finals, but all the expats were screaming their heads off for a team with no chance.  I’m still puzzling this out, but somehow I think it wasn’t coincidence but rather a happy trait.</p>
<p>Moving from the developed world to the developing world is about more than lifestyle engineering.  At some level expats are trading themselves to a new team–a scrappy up-comer with lots of opportunity and room for improvement, where a person coming from the outside with new ideas, energy and capital can be a meaningful contributor to a better future.</p>
<p>At the same time, they don’t have their expectations fixed on any definite result.  Is Panama going to attain the tidy efficiency of a Switzerland in our lifetimes?  About as likely as Ghana winning the World Cup (which is to say just possible enough to make it fun to watch). But the happy expat seems to understand that life is about the journey, not the destination.  For them, watching little Ghana advance one round was infinitely more satisfying than rooting for the favorite Spain to win the World Cup–just like being a part of Panama’s little successes as it tries to make its way into the ranks of developed world countries.</p>

<p>Six years ago (wao!) we wrote two articles about the people we met through the years moving abroad, specifically relocating to Panama.  This week, we re read the articles and were surprised on how relevant they still are, and worth sharing again.</p>
<p>If you´ve been thinking on relocating (to Panama or anywhere), we do recommend you to read both of them from A to Z.  I know, reading these days takes time, but worth doing for such a big decision. Can´t we just make an infographic? humm&#8230;. no&#8230;.  =) A video would be fun though!</p>
<p>They were two articles: The Happy Expat (Part I): Unhappy Expats  and the second one, about those who make it or &#8220;The Happy Expat&#8221;</p>
<p>Here it goes! First delivery:</p>

<p>A couple years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article for The New Yorker about how there are certain jobs that defy our ability to predict who will be successful and who will fail once they are hired.  The article cited schoolteachers and professional American football quarterbacks as two examples of jobs where almost nothing we can learn about a candidate before he is hired will tell us how well he will do in the job. The article got me thinking about the many people I have seen succeed, and the few I have seen fail, transitioning from a developed country to our little corner of a developing one.</p>
<p>I am a real estate broker in Casco Antiguo with Arco Properties, a walled colonial town that abuts bustling Panama City.  During my six years in the business, I have sold or rented to approximately 120 foreigners.  I even married one.  All of these people brought their hopes and dreams to my country. They came excited to make a new life for themselves. The vast majority have flourished.  They’ve built businesses, started families, made friends (and in some cases fortunes). They’ve engineered a special lifestyle for themselves they could never have anywhere else and, I am sure, will never return to their home countries.  They are now hyphenated Panamanians; part of a growing diaspora of developed world expats who I believe will prove to be one of the great sea changes of this century.</p>
<p>But a few wound up regretting their decision to move. Somehow Panama didn’t live up to their expectations. The trials and frustrations of a developing country, the inefficiencies, the disorganization took their toll and pushed these people past their breaking point.  But everyone here, particularly foreigners, are subject to the same conditions, so why do some foreigners thrive while others become frustrated, burnt out and eventually leave?</p>
<p>I had both personal and professional reasons for wanting to be able to better predict who would transition successfully and who would fail.  Obviously, unhappy clients are bad for business, and part of a realtor’s role is to help her clients make the right decision for themselves, but in my case it is even more personal than that.  In a small historic district like ours, your clients are your neighbors and your neighbors are your friends.  You want everyone to be happy. To see someone slowly burn out and become frustrated, knowing that at some level they relied on you to make such a large life decision is a heavy burden.</p>
<p>So I meditated on the question and analyzed case-by-case the happy and the unhappy expats I had dealt with here.  As I did, I began to see some patterns emerge. It’s nothing scientific–and probably couldn’t be since you never really know what is going on inside someone else’s’ mind– but it’s given me some insights that help me better counsel my clients.  The context is people moving from a developed country to a historic district in a Latin American country because that is what I know, but I would think that the insights apply to anyone moving from a developed country to a less developed one.</p>
<p>For those who feel there might be a fit between them and a historic district like our Casco, I am publishing a separate series that goes into the nuts and bolts of successfully engineering what we have come to (half-kiddingly) refer to a Cosmotropical life style in our historic district.</p>
<p><strong>UN-HAPPY EXPATS ARE ALL ALIKE</strong></p>
<p>In the famous opening line of Ana Karenina, Tolstoy says “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” My father-in-law is fond of saying that old Leo got it backwards: it’s the unhappy families that are all alike–they’ve got one of several problems–money, infidelity, substance abuse, love gone cold, kid issues–but the happy families each have their own special little chemistry that keeps them together despite the vicissitudes of life, and that chemistry defies being reduced to a formula.</p>
<p>I tend to think my father-in-law is right, and that his philosophy applies to expats.  When I look back at my list of hundreds of expats I’ve known, it is much easier to see patterns among the few who left than the majority who stayed.  Not that there aren’t things to learn from the happy expats, it’s just that there are fewer things that I would consider predictors.  Below I’ve touched on the three main predictors of unhappiness, and in the second part of this article I will look at some of the ingredients I’ve seen in the chemistry of the happy expats.</p>
<p><strong>1. If you are not happy anywhere, you won’t be happy here. </strong></p>
<p>In my experience, the most frequent cause of unhappiness among expats is that they were simply unhappy people to begin with. Somehow they had convinced themselves that “getting away from it all” and “starting over” in a new place would bring them true happiness.  I’ve now become very attuned to people who quickly dive into stories of how unfair life has been to them, the complaints, the broken relationships they need to get away from.  My advice when I hear it is “get a shrink”–expatriating is not the answer.</p>
<p>If you feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown, moving to a developing country is probably the worst thing you can do.  You need a predictable, stable environment, where you can focus on yourself, work through your issues and repair your relationships.  You may have an idealized conception of the tropics as more laid back, less regulated, less stressful, but unless you are on holiday, it takes a while before it becomes those things.  For your first couple of years it’s tough. It bumps you around, it challenges your assumptions of what’s logical, fair, right.  If you are not very comfortable in your own skin and don’t have good coping mechanisms the developing world will make you more nuts than you already are.</p>
<p><strong>2. The best way to become a millionaire in Latin America is to start with a billion. </strong></p>
<p>The second most common reason for unhappy expats in my experience is that they get themselves into financial trouble.  This is most often the case with entrepreneurs, which many expats here tend to be.</p>
<p>It is well known that most new businesses fail within the first two years.  It is also well known that it is more risky to start a business in an environment you are not familiar with than it is to start one in your own back yard.</p>
<p>It is therefore astounding to me how many people move to Panama and put their life savings at risk starting a business in an industry they do not know, where they don’t speak the language, know the customs or have personal networks.  Sitting bleary-eyed in your New York office at three a.m. behind a pile of papers, you might convince yourself that opening a bar in a tropical paradise like Panama is a quaint, stress-free way to make a living, but ask yourself: would I take the risk on the exact same thing down my own block? If not, listen to your own excuses for not doing it on your own turf: too much competition, too many legal hassles, cost of living too high, don’t know anything about bars….</p>
<p>Well, the deck is stacked against you even more here.  It’s certainly possible–but you cannot go in making unsupported assumptions about the time things take, the cost of doing things right (meaning at the level you are accustomed to), who you can trust or the quality of the labor pool.  You must do your homework and leave large cushions of time and capital, otherwise you are very likely to find yourself a very unhappy expat for a very good reason: you’re broke.</p>
<p>It’s too early in my area’s development to really know the failure rate for expat businesses, but of the thirty or so I’ve seen open, only a few have failed.  I think the reason it is not higher is because this is a fast growing market and often expats come in with insights into where the market is heading that makes up for some of their other competitive disadvantages.  If they have a decent idea, enough capital and stick it out long enough they normally do fine, and some even get rich.   But my experience is that the best bet is to have a nest egg or a source of income outside of Panama that allows you to take advantage of its low cost of living without being overly exposed to its tricky business climate.  If you want to dabble in a side business to see how it goes, great. But whatever you do don’t take one big roll of the dice on a bumpy felt like this one. And if you do and it goes wrong, please don’t blame the country–statistics say it probably would have happened at home.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Living in your own private Panama.</strong></p>
<p>The previous two reasons account for almost all of the unhappy expats I have seen.  There is another condition that often accompanies one or both of the others that I define as unrealistic expectations.  Essentially, these are people who want Panama to be something that it simply isn’t and when they realize it, they refuse to adjust and become unhappy because they feel that they have been betrayed.</p>
<p>If naivety is a legitimate excuse, then this feeling is justified; there is an unlimited amount of propaganda floating around on the internet selling Panama as a species of tropical paradise that it isn’t (and nowhere else could be). If you’re expecting paradise, pretty much anything that really exists in this world is going to disappoint you.</p>
<p>What I’ve learned to listen for in this respect are the words “should” and “ought”.  If someone recently arrived in Panama frequently mentions that “Panama should” do this, or “they ought” to do the other, I can be pretty certain that this person will soon become an unhappy expat. Whether or not they are correct on their observations, the fact that they are focused on how things should be rather than trying to understanding why they are the way they are tells me that they probably don’t have the coping skills they need to deal with this imperfect environment. It’s got it’s good and it’s bad; the job of the expat is to do his research before moving to make sure that the rough edges between his personality and Panama are a good fit.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, I have found that quite often the things they think “should” be, if done, would create exactly the circumstances that they say they didn’t like in their home country.  A typical case is when people find out that there is no real cause of action for negligence here. They claim to hate the litigiousness of the US, but the first time they step in an open manhole they think that they ought to be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p>The key to happiness here, as anywhere, is focusing on the positive and the things you can change and letting the rest go. As an expat, it is important to have the cultural intuition and curiosity that allows you to understand why things are the way they are.  Everyone, including locals, occasionally meanders into the land of should and ought, but living there is a sure fire way to make yourself miserable no matter where you are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>It was a long and bumpy road with Hotel Central. But after more or less 7 years, there was light at the end of the tunel: the hotel is opening! still a couple of weeks more for the rooms to be available to the public, but their main restaurant Nueve Reinas has opened.</p>
<p>It is an Argentinian style restaurant with specialty in meats. We ordered the tuna tataki for some balance. One of our friends ordered her meat red and the other one ordered his meat 3/4. They both loved it.  We ordered tataki and corvina and they were both very good.</p>
<p>Thumbs up and congratulations! looking forward to having the full 135 room operating hotel!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Last Thursday, we went to the Prisma Dance Festival performance at the Anita Villalaz Theatre in Casco Viejo.  Two companies. one from Hungary and one from South Korea. Ferenc Feher from Hungary had an interesting concept based on the Tao Te Ching about humans living in harmony. But it was the South Korean troupe that stole the night with Swan Lake, five swans losing their homes due to pollution, dying at the end of exhaustion. Tchaikovsky´s music had the perfect notes for everything: drama and comedy. But the end was done in silence, as it should be.</p>
<p>What a performance! thanks so much to the Prisma Dance Festival! thumbs up!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Friday night was the official  opening for Benissimo Gelato &amp; Caffe on the  corner of Avenida A and Calle 4.   After one taste, the coconut became an instant favorite. Bits of coconut are there down to the last lick.  Besides gelato, choose from their bacon mozzarella waffle or waffle with nutella con banano accompanied by  a cappuccino.  On Saturday, I dropped in for a panini de pavo as more than 100 assorted motorcycles roared through the Casco. Stop by, introduce yourself to Jose Manuel and his staff.</p>

<p>275 maps including a map by Juan de la Cosa back in 1501 (he was the pilot for Christopher Columbus) are being shown at Casa Soldado, Las Bóvedas. Each one with an interesting story behind, weaving the history of the &#8220;New World&#8221; and Panama.  La Estrella article mentioned, for example, that in 1574, Panama became the first &#8220;country&#8221; in America to have a map of its current territory. And then there are others like the route for &#8220;el polvo de oro&#8221; (golden dust) and so on. If you love history, you´ll enjoy this exhibit!</p>

<p>25 August, CASCOMAR opened.  Last night, fifteen Casqueños  got together to check out the tapas.  Formerly La Rose de los Vientos, the restaurant is tucked away on the corner of  Avenida 9 Sur on the back side of Iglesia San Jose and Calle 8.  Our tables extended almost half the length of the  terrace along the seawall. Martha, the owner, recommended an authentic <em>tortilla espanol </em>and <em>croquetas de jamon iberico ,</em>delicious.  Their house white wine is an Albarino from Spain. Before the weekend, some of us will be back for dinner.  It was a delightful evening on a quiet  back street. Cascomar is open for dinners Tuesday thru Sunday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cascoyogapanama.com/">Casco Yoga</a> has a full month coming! fun events and classes. Check them out, from Maya´s newsletter:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the amazing turn out and response for Jackie’s Yoga Dance Master Class on August 27th Casco decided to repeat this event on a monthly basis. As Jackie is training for a few weeks in the States in September the next one will be in October.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This Thursday September 1st we are starting our second 14 day Challenge after the success of the first back in June. Looking forward to good vibes on and off the mat! (This is also available for anyone that has packages open, we can freeze these during this time.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On September 3rd we will do our first RUN-YOGA-BEER Event!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On Saturday September 10th Leah Bess Murray wil be holding a beautiful workshop at the studio (special prices for Challengers).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are working closely with Leah to organise a Yoga Retreat during the Surf&amp;Yoga Festival in Bocas del Toro. Stay tuned for more information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition, on september 17th we are having another RUN-YOGA-BEER Event ending with a small celebration at the studio for Edwin and Maya’s upcoming wedding.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Please check our website/social media on a regular basis to stay up to date with the current schedule and for information on events. We made a small change regarding classes considering the traffic on Thursdays and Fridays (classes are 30 min later; 5:30 pm and 6:45 pm).</li>
</ul>

<p>Many don´t realize Santa Ana is part of Casco Viejo. For many year, the Plaza Santa Ana was the political epicenter of the whole town: marches, gatherings, protests and celebrations.  Their streets have tons of history and characters, and now you can tour them with the help of an app by LiveWalkPty .  It has 12 stories &#8220;told&#8221; by Chaflán, a local charater. From poetry to the history of buildings, this is an interesting way to learn about our beloved city.</p>

<p>So proud of the Enlaces kids! In June, one of their students, José, was invited to participate in Danza Juvenil Opus 1 at Eslovenia. José travelled with his teacher José Leonardo Amaya, and on the way they passed by Paris.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Enlaces, this is Fundación Calicanto´s after school dance program that focuses on kids from Casco Viejo and Chorrillo. They have a nice group of young kids who already started to perform and some of the more advanced ones have tried their own choreographies and have participated in major productions on stage.</p>
<p>Proud of José and the Enlaces team!</p>

<p>I learned a new word: Mahalo. In Hawaiian it means &#8221; thanks, gratitude, admiration, praise, esteem, regards, or respects&#8221;.  Now we have our own Casco style &#8220;Mahalo&#8221;, located on A Avenue, next to UnderCover boots, right after 5th and A, by Madrigal. Yes, we do give a lot of landmarks, that´s how our system works!</p>
<p>Last night´s soft opening had a really good vibe. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/289274711423316/">Mahalo </a>will offer fresh food, pilates and yoga classes.  They´ll be offering deconstructed sushi, burritos, and salads to go. Soft spot for me: they´ll give you the jars, so you can bring them back and refill. Less waste! love it.</p>
<p>They also have cold press juices, and sauces made by chef José Carles from Donde José. The food is perfect for a healthy breakfast and lunch, for dinner they´ll also offer tapas, beer and wine.  The garden at the back is a really nice hang out.</p>
<p>Welcome Mahalo!</p>

<p>Walking in Casco Viejo during the rain is a lot of fun. If it catches you off guard, you can always run from under balconies. But when the weather gives you a bit of a heads up, people come out with their fashion boots and raincoats. It anyways lasts only an hour (maybe!), so why not have fun while at it?</p>
<p>Not sure where these boots are from, but we have Undercover Boots!</p>

<p>Today, the program Enlaces put together a really nice performance for parents and program supporters showing the student´s latest work. If you don´t know much about the program, it works with children from Chorrillo, Santa Ana and San Felipe, developing skills and tools for life through contemporary dance.</p>
<p>Loved the choreography and how dedicated the kids were. Amazing music!</p>

But instead of hopping in the car and burning your gas, take a nice bike ride to Casco!  By chance, this Sunday I ran into some friends whose hobby is bicycle riding. So they routinely ride their bikes with their whole family from Paitilla to Casco on Sundays. They told me that a lot of people like doing that because they can park their bikes at Unido where there’s a trusty bike rack (see picture), and then have a coffee inside. Afterwards they spend their Sunday walking around Casco. Lifestyle!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Funny, but once we are out of school / university, our lives tend to have on its natural flow mainly two types of communication: social media (and mainly emoticons!) and work related stuff.  I was warned by my old literature teacher that this was going to happen! but was she wrong?</p>
<p>Maybe. I mean, each one of us contains rivers of feelings, words, thoughts, and crazy ideas running inside us, we just don´t know what to do with it. Some people even create damns. But Lili Mendoza has no damns, I´ll tell you that. If you want to see a river in action, and risk having your own gates break open, you have to go to her creative writing workshop.</p>
<p>If you read Spanish, the following blog will give you an idea. It is signed by veterinarian Enrique Samudio: http://www.quevi.org/?p=91</p>
<p>Mainly in Spanish, but Lili is one of the few that can do creative writing in English as well. here is a bit about her: <a href="http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/extaffairs/content/docs/stocktimes/StocktonTimesJune62013.pdf">Stockton Times article</a>. Be prepared for Spanglish, her favorite language.</p>
<p>How does it work? the group meets in a spot in Casco, which changes from day to day. The last class was held inside the Religious Art Museum by Arco Chato. Both for visitors and locals, it is a way to look at the city in a different way, to experience it from a different angle. Perfect recipe to start writing!</p>
<p>How to get in touch with Lili? usually her facebook is pretty good. Or if you would like to go to her QueVi website: http://www.quevi.org/    and her email info@quevi.org</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Casco Viejo is full of beautiful moments in nature. I just wanted to take a minute to share some of the photos I´ve taken from the beach. I specially love mornings and evenings!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Hate condo meetings? You are not alone. At their best, they are boring. At their worst&#8230; they put to the test your every skill , including &#8211; and not limited to- pranayama breathing. Spending your evening with your family looks like a really nice option. So is walking on top of nails. Anything but a condo meeting!</p>
<p>But here is the thing: whether you made an investment or you live in the building, the first step to long term value is your active involvement.</p>
<p>In Casco Viejo, where condos are small, this is particularly important. Do you really want big changes voted without your consent or even your knowledge? with only a few units on each building, this is perfectly possible. Make sure you are always at the table, and advocate for everyone to take and active roll. After all, most buildings in Casco (with a few exceptions) only have between 4 to 10 units.</p>
<p>Casco´s best buildings so far have shared that characteristic: owners who live in the building, are part of the board of directors.</p>
<p>They make for a healthier building, and a prosperous one. Investments are made in the right places, administrators and concierges tend to do a better job, and they are able to compete shoulder to shoulder with brand new condos that tend to have more amenities and even better design. They keep and raise their values in both rents and sales.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the opposite is also true.</p>
<p>There are many ways to protect your investment. But very few as important and proven as living in the condo you buy or keeping a close eye / presence at the owner´s association meetings and a line of communicating with the board and administrator. If you feel they are not doing their job, you´ll have the tools to change it. And sometimes that energy is all a building needs to come back around.</p>

<p>Via Plural is a street art event that takes place at Avenida Central, Santa Ana. Last year, it gathered around 300 artists who performed along the commercial side of La Central all the way to Plaza 5 de Mayo.  From breakdance to really good bands, from street poetry to aerial dancing, we were impressed by the quality and the concept.</p>
<p>This year, Via Plural´s second edition is May 21st.  It is roughly from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Stuff will happen along Central. Mostly street art all day long, but what they call teh &#8220;artistic ciruit&#8221; will be from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.  An urban market will also be happening, at the other side: Plaza Centenario, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/laviaplural/">HERE is their Facebook page</a> if you want to learn more.</p>

<p>Shopping in Avenida A is getting better and better. This week, UnderCover Boots inaugurated a beautiful space, between Madrigal and Lupa. The place was packed with neighbors, children, everyone. A beautiful store, great products. Colorful rainboots for everyone (and right on time for Panama´s rainy season!) painted or created by local artists. Of course, I was already wearing them going in&#8230; mine had the &#8220;papo&#8221; flower, but I really loved the &#8220;guayacan&#8221; long boots and the Rana Dorada elegant black. Depending on the boot you buy, they donate to different organizations, including the Smithonian frog team in Panama, who are working on research and preservation of Panama´s golden frog.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>This past week, La Prensa published an article about the need to renew the posts that mark the Panama- Costa Rica frontier, as they are old and some of those posts are even missing.  When I read it, I couldn´t help but to smile. My grandpa put those posts down back in the 40´s, boy! they´ve lasted!!!</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn´t the first one to draw physicaly a line between the two countries. Here is a whole<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontera_entre_Costa_Rica_y_Panam%C3%A1"> page of its history (Wiki</a>).  But of course, I grew up listening to the stories. When he passed away, my cousin gave me to safe keep the instrument he used to meassure. It is in a wooden box that weighs &#8220;like a bad marriage&#8221;.  Talk about quality: the box is still hard and solid, no termite has dared to taste it.</p>
<p>I had seen photos of my grandfather dressed up in full jungle gear: boots, big hat, long sleeves. Think early explorers in Africa. He used to tell us how they would go up and down mountains in the middle of the forest. The team would include engineers, workmen, and &#8211; of course- someone who played the guitar. Fighting boredom was as important as fighting mosquitoes. At night, only the sounds of the jungle, and the sounds of the guitar, under that amazing sky filled with stars.</p>
<p>The other challenge, believe it or not, was coming up with names for the hills and places they were marking.  He would laugh at how creative they were at the beginning, really thinking things through. But at some point, after weeks of jungle, animals, insects, sweat and carrying all the equipment, they just started to name things after the first thing that came to mind. Yes, that´s the true story of how and why Panama ended up with a number of hills called &#8220;lizard&#8221; and &#8220;white stones&#8221;. Not to mention &#8220;flat creek&#8221; and &#8220;fat sugar cane&#8221;.   Now, I know that  other countries have faced similar challenges and met them with a similar approach. How else could you explain Greasy Creek? It´s in my bucket list, have to go see it!</p>

<p>As a realtor, I often meet clients who are moving in and out of apartments. Buying furniture is a major concern. Some don´t mind it, while others are worried that they won´t be able to take it with them when they move out. That is why I was so glad to bump into Serie Infinita at Lupa: a modular series of tables that can be used in a number of ways and can fit almost any corner and style. You can change tops and colors. And they seem pretty easy to ship!</p>
<p>Take a look, and call <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LUPA-1700992696800210/?fref=ts">Ingrid at Lupa if you are interested. </a></p>

<p>This past weekend was a holiday in Panama. As usual, everything closed, and a lazy mood around with the rainy season finally here. I needed to do my grocery shopping, and was anyways walking down central with a friend,  so got into El Machetazo to get some basics. Usually this is my &#8220;to go&#8221; place for diy crafts and beach cleaning projects.  I was pleasantly surprised! they´ve been updating their food products, I ended up with a full cart of veggies, fruits, cheese, yogurt, salmon, and more.  $42 later, I was set for the week. Here is a photo of what I bought (but after using a bunch of stuff for a really good stew)</p>

<p>When you live in Casco you are constantly exploring new places.  Last Friday, we went to Santa Rita, Casa Panama´s groundfloor restaurant. A super warm welcome by the manager, her recommendations were really good. They have Spanish cuisine, from the famous callos to nice octopus carpaccio.

<p>Last night, Teatro Balboa was packed. The movie showing was the Panamanian movie Salsipuedes, almost entirely shot in Casco Viejo (Yes, there were some airport shots we didn´t get! ). The story was well put together, and the casting included children from the neighborhood, incredible talent! I didn´t realize how incredibly diverse Casco was for a film maker: the beach, plazas, old buildings, new buildings, rural look, city look, you can cut and paste depending on what you want to achive.</p>
<p>Congratulations, well done! here is the trailer: (there are English subtitles)</p>

<p>A beautifully restored St Francis of Asis Church received everyone this Easter weekend. Hundreds of visitors on a couple of days, the place looks amazing.  What I particularly love about this church is how present nature is: moon, sun, rainbows. This is the only church that every year does a pet procession, which I´m very fond of.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Ricardo Gago and Mario Lewis for this amazing effort!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like nothing I´ve ever seen in Casco before: people literally in a line, trying to get in. That is a first. Just like a really busy restaurant in New York or something like that, La Michoacana has clearly become Casco´s new addiction, at the corner of B Avenue and 8th Street. I haven´t tried their lolly pops, and now I´m scared to try them. Maybe if I do, I will too be making the line every Friday night&#8230;</p>
<p>My solution is to ask you to go and tell me!</p>

<p>I think the entrepreneurial movement that Panama is experiencing is historic and exciting.  People from all parts of our society, sharing, exchanging&#8230; producing. Yes, producing with their own hands whatever their label is selling, literally from their parents home. This is the Panamanian version of a startup in a garage. For someone that knows Panamanian society this is groundbreaking, and best of all, gathering momentum.</p>
<p>This weekend at MACRO we could see a good part of the best vendors that produce art /design/ fashion related merchandise. They are getting better and having fun while at it together. If this is a hint of our future world, then the world is full of hope.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>People in the neighborhood knows him as Shingi, o El Flaco. He earns a living washing cars and as a watchman for properties. His address is always changing, but you can find him most of the time at the same corner, by El Colegio.</p>
<p>He was born Manuel Sacramento, and a he is a street artist. He´s been producing paintings and drawings of Casco Viejo and life in general. Using everything he can get his hands on,  I´ve heard he´s even used melted candy to paint when didn´t have money to buy proper paint.  This week, his works are being shown at Casa Soldado for MACRO festival, along with other local and international artists.</p>
<p>Several things makes his street art special to us. His blending of nature and buildings in Casco, his optimistic, colorful palette, no matter how hard life might be for him at any given moment.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Casa Soldado and MACRO for including Shingi´s work on their show. It was awesome! congratulations Shingi!</p>

<p>This past Sunday, the Municipality started a program that turns a portion of Avenida Central into a pedestrian street.  From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. , starting at Plaza Santa Ana and until the parking next to the National Theater, this street will be car free.</p>
<p>Cars will still be allowed into Casco, as a matter of fact, no changes will be made on how you enter or exit, other than you can´t access Central Avenue. Parking at the National Theater and behind Plaza Herrera will be available, as well as public transportation from the Cinta Costera into Casco, for those who want to leave the car outside and save the stress.</p>
<p>This event will be repeated every Sunday, a perfect moment to come with the family and enjoy Casco Viejo&#8230; walking!</p>

<p>Welcoming new casqueños is always a pleasure, even more when they are pioneers like our buyers in Casa Patterson, a development by Grupo Conservatorio at La Quince in Santa Ana. This weekend we had a get together barbeque for everyone to meet and share.</p>
<p>The delicious bbq was courtesy of our development director and ad honorem BBQ Chef for life, Andy. The pasta by our neighbor, &#8220;Iron Chef&#8221; and collaborator, Gabriel who also directed the making of the different salads, executed by our marketing director, Margot.  Fernando, from the neighborhood association (AVACA) gave everyone the official welcoming to the neighborhood with a brief historic talk about Santa Ana and the programs they can join to contribute to the barrio. The tour to the project (close to completion!) was given by the construction team and the &#8220;Arco girls&#8221;.</p>
<p>We had a blast! stories and jokes, everyone was excited. For us, Casa Patterson is an important step towards our vision of what urban revitalization means: to achieve a revitalization where there is space for everyone, with a mix and interaction that reinforces the identity of the neighborhood and city, through its diversity.</p>
<p>To all the buyers and now new owners, congratulations! Not only because you made a wonderful long term investment that you´ll be able to pass on to your children, but because you´ve chosen to contribute to a larger and very important vision for the future of our country.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>So, what is B Corps?it is an international certification that looks into a business processes and impact, whether social or environmental, committing them to a high standard of transparency and accountability. This certification currently exists in more than 50 countries, and in Panama there is a pioneer group of companies including our very own Grupo Conservatorio. Within the group, Hotel Las Clementinas is Panama´s first hotel to comply with the B Corp certification.</p>
<p>This is a changing world, and the conversation of how you impact is very dear to our hearts and minds. The concept of how you do business is evolving. It used to be enough to have a social responsibility department. But the concept has evolved into making sure that the whole company and its impact is being addressed, that it is in its DNA. It is a window that opens wide and invites all for profits to re visit their objectives and look deep into their impacts.</p>
<p>This is exciting for us, so we would like to congratulate Las Clementinas for submitting and achieving compliance, becoming Panama´s first B Corp hotel!</p>

<p>There are always so many different things that you can be part of in this neighborhood.  Take this week, for example: yesterday, a chess tournament at Plaza Catedral.  Walk any night by Plaza Herrera around 7 p.m., and you´ll see children (and young adults!!!) playing &#8220;Calle 7&#8221;, a popular TV show with the classic obstacle race. They use every since bench in the park, and are quite good at it! in the middle of the laughing and crazy running, a group of about 100 or more ciclysts entered the scene, going around the plaza and then on to tour Casco. Quite an impressive view!</p>

<p>Last night we were at a beautiful event by Zaira and Ana at Papiro y yo / Franklin Panamá: a Yo Lucho (I fight) event pro Panama´s Cancer Association. A wonderful night full of laughter and beautiful, hand made merchandise that makes a difference no matter which day of the year you buy it. Last night it helped both cancer and the amazing ladies at Panama´s country side who create them. Good business, good people, good causes.  That´s my kind of shopping!</p>

<p>I am impressed. Finally, a biodigestor at the San Felipe Market! the Basura Cero program from the Major´s office has installed the first biodigestor as a prototipe to apply to the rest of the city´s markets. This is a huge step that took into account suggestions made from our community. The markets are known to produce a lot of organic garbage, that inevitably ends up on our streets.</p>
<p>This bio digestor is reported to have a capacity of 2.5m3 and can process up to 45 pounds daily.</p>
<p>We are glad that the Major´s office has taken Casco Viejo as the perfect place to try out this technology. This, along with a pilot program from the Garbage Authority that has raised the garbage recollection frequency is helping Casco get closer to the goal: Basura Cero &#8211; Zero Garbage.</p>

<p>Historic photos are always so much fun! when you know the area, they are always interesting. These I bumped into the office of a friend who said that clients loved them. I was surprised by the beauty of the balconies of the buildings towards Plaza 5 de Mayo. If you notice, they are very much like the ones in Colón, where the arches extended over the sidewalk, offering shade and protection from the rain. So needed in this tropical environment. Apparently, a number of these buildings used to be this way, but they were cut back when the road was widened because of the increase on vehicles.  When looking back, it is always astonishing how cars have ended up shaping our cities, and cutting down beauty.</p>
<p>The question now is: how can we bring this back?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>This week, an interesting article came out in the newspaper about how banks are tightening up procedures to avoid money laundrying. This is a tendency everywhere, Panama is no exception.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to remind everyone about the basics of how to apply for financing in Panama. If you are travelling and thinking seriously to buy, it is worth while bringing these documents with you, so you can make the best out of your trip. It will serve you well with banks, lawyers and realtors, as they all have the duty by law to fullfill a strong due diligence.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every bank will require a personal interview. Try visiting at least 3, so you have a broad understanding of what is being offered.</li>
<li>At this stage, if you are only gathering information, a simple copy of your documents would be fine, for just assestment. Once you start really the process, keep in mind that everything is required in original, notarized AND apostilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Bank letters of reference</li>
<li>2 Commercial letters of reference</li>
<li>2 Years of tax returns</li>
<li>Your last 6 months of your bank account (Statement)</li>
<li>If you are American, they´ll ask the 2 last 1040 and W2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, they´ll take a copy of your passport.</p>
<p>As a foreigner, you can get up to 70% financing on your home or apartment, and up to 50% if it is a commercial purchase. If you are already living in Panama, and have been here for more than 2 years, you´ll probably have access to more.</p>
<p>Depending on the bank, they might be faster or slower to open a bank account for you. Do ask the officer you are meeting about this specifically, what is required, and how long would it take.</p>
<p>Law 136 of 2014 for Casco Viejo provides a special 3% rate for purchases in Casco, so if you have a strong profile and are considering buying here, do know this is an option for you.</p>

<p>We went to Iceland a while ago, and thought was how incredibly beautiful the Blue Lagoon was. Every photo and add showed it exactly the way it was.  This is how I feel about Pearl Islands, it is every bit of amazing as you see it in the video posted below. Now, with Casco Charters, this experience is only 45 minutes away from you. You can take a trip on their Maramesa from Flamigo, or straight out from Casco Viejo if you book the smaller boat and go to Taboga (this takes only 20 minutes).  Fishing, whale watching, island hoping, you name it!</p>
<p>Check out their website: Casco Charters <a href="http://cascocharters.com/">HERE </a></p>
<p>But their Facebook has these amazing videos you need to watch: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Casco-Charters-SA/623960081066568?fref=ts">FACEBOOK</a></p>

What an event! Aside from the concert, what we loved was how they really took the effort to reach out to ngo´s and make them part of the event.  Dances where presented from children at Aprojusan and the Enlaces program at Calicanto. Food included the boys from the Fortaleza tour of the Esperanza program.  Young rapper Jacobo, the son of Nico from La Vecindad had the chance to share stage with one of the oldest reggueton singers in Panama (Nando Boom), back when the genre was being invented. They have also open their doors to internships, one of Aprojusan´s young graduates is already working with them.  And they even recycled! which was very much appreciated! <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/recycling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10527" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/recycling-300x225.jpg" alt="recycling" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/recycling-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/recycling-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/interns.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10528" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/interns-300x225.jpg" alt="interns" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/interns-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/interns-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fortaleza-comida.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10529" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fortaleza-comida-300x225.jpg" alt="Fortaleza comida" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fortaleza-comida-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fortaleza-comida-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dancers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10530" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dancers-300x225.jpg" alt="dancers" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dancers-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dancers-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Banistmo-people.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10531" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Banistmo-people-300x225.jpg" alt="Banistmo people" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Banistmo-people-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Banistmo-people-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Aprojusan-bailes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10532" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Aprojusan-bailes-300x225.jpg" alt="Aprojusan bailes" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Aprojusan-bailes-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Aprojusan-bailes-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />

<p>Sunday morning we woke up and we couldn´t believe the weekend we just had. What a historic moment for Panama! international music stars, legends like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Shorter">Wayne Shorter</a> in our own backyard, playing amazing music, having fun. From the Danilo Perez Jazz Club special night with Wayne Shorter, to the Percussion Festival at the Anita Villalaz with musicians such as <a href="http://impresa.prensa.com/mosaico_dominical/percusion-lenguaje_0_4279072072.html">Danni Clovis</a> and <a href="http://remo.com/portal/artists/4717/Jimmie_Morales.html">Jimmie Morales</a>. We enjoyed every single moment, and everyone stood up to the challenge.  Still speechless for local new young talent coming out of the Danilo Perez Foundation: Richard Santamaría.  What a kid&#8230; remember that name!</p>
<p>But the absolute best was to see them all together, when Danilo took the piano for a last jamming with everyone. The stage was on fire!</p>

<p>We always celebrate new retail coming to Casco, but specially if it is retail with a strong social tie. This is the case of<a href="http://www.toms.com/"> TOMS</a>, a store that is known around the world for giving <a href="http://www.toms.com/improving-lives">one on one</a>, meaning that each shoe that you buy, represents a shoe for a child in need, and that every pair of eyewear you buy, they invest in eye health for someone that needs it.</p>
<p>They are located at Hotel Colombia, next to Casablanca, at Plaza Bolivar. They´ll open from 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. , so there is no excuse not to pass by! Welcome guys!</p>

<p>A number of years, Arco surveyed among the neighbors what type of businesses they needed the most. Among them were: a pharmacy, a grocery store, a bank. Step by step, we´ve been bringing them to the neighborhood.  Not always an easy task! That is why we would like to celebrate today another historic landmark: Casco´s first bank in San Felipe. I don´t think the town had one since the 70´s.</p>
<p>Banistmo opened this week at Casa Lewis, Plaza Herrera, corner of 9th and A Avenue. They´ll be open from Monday to Friday (9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.) and Saturdays (9 a.m. to 12 noon.). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Banistmo/photos/a.639985286046530.1073741828.594741753904217/1015731641805224/?type=1&amp;theater">More info at their Facebook Page HERE</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Walking is something most of us take for granted. We walk from point A to B without giving much thought. But this experience hits us, the way vitamins do: you just don´t notice them, until you are out of them and get a really bad flu. When done with full awareness, you start connecting your feelings to your thoughts on why you feel the way you do when you are in places you like and places you don´t.  It hits you when places get destroyed. It lifts you when places feel &#8220;right&#8221;, and somehow &#8220;thoughtful&#8221;.  For the latest one, yes, probably there was a lot of thought put in them, the kind that is generated by an activity like Jane´s Walk.</p>
<p>So, what is it? in short is a walk with awareness of your space. Probably you´ll have someone that is an urbanist with you, as a guide on what to see, the historic contexts, so that the group analyzes by being phisically there what makes a place special, livable, great&#8230; or not.</p>
<p>In Panama, this simple, but yet powerful way to get a conversation started about our cities is picking up. Today, a full article was featured in La Prensa on the young architect that is organizing them for the Municipio. The article is obvioulsy about what, how, where and who, but what gets us excited is that it is happening. After so many years in Casco planting the seed for walking districts, finally, the plant has started to root and sprout.</p>
<p>Exciting!</p>

<p>This weekend our friend Leo sent us an incredible photo: Plaza Santa Ana being used as a Bull Ring. While I had seen photos of Plaza Catedral and even Plaza Herrera being used as such, I had never seen Plaza Santa Ana. Check out the details of the surrounding buildings, completely changed today.  Cerro Ancon at the back. What a jewel!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday was the final day of a full month of activities organized by World Pride Panama, an organization that raises awarenes for the LGBT community in our country. The activities included workshops open to everyone, from personal branding to corporate and legal. They even had a job fair that was a full success. The big event, though, was the march on Sunday.  It ended with a fun concert at Plaza V Centenario. Casco´s streets were dressed in rainbows, and happy energy flooded the airwaves.  It was a beautiful moment for everyone who came to participate and support.</p>

<p>What a great concept, four nights, four dinners, four duets of neighbors competing, and everyone having fun. Last night was the first round, and it was for our dear personal trainner, musician and young chef, Angel Gordon and his friend Roxana Guevara. Their concept was a &#8220;healthy meal&#8221;, and presented a lovely salmon with salad, really a wonderful dish to eat as many times as you´d like.</p>
<p>Here are some photos of the very &#8220;serious&#8221; judges: foodie Clara Hardin, hospitality expert James Rice and chef José Carles.</p>
<p>Who´s next?</p>
<p>June 20th´: Eva and Marc Forma, from Spain</p>
<p>June 25th: Ryan and Tamara Bullock, from Panama and the USA</p>
<p>June 27th: Gabriel Preciado and Felipe Fierro, from Panama and Colombia</p>
<p>All dinners start at 8 p.m. , and the meal is for $15. Wine or drinks not included!</p>

<p>Truth be said, the whole country paralyzed Monday morning. In a historic moment, Panama started to play soccer (football) for the very first time, in a World Cup at Russia. Every single TV was focused on this event, every restaurant, ice cream shop, every store. Everyone watching closely, dressed in the famous &#8220;red tide&#8221; and supporting our &#8220;sele&#8221;.  Super proud of their performance! Arco was &#8220;working&#8221; from Benissimo in Calle 4ta&#8230; here are some photos!</p>

<p>Last night we inaugurated El Colegio 2, first building in Casco (and Panama) with offices and mechanized parking. Thanks to the German company Klaus, we could see first hand how the whole thing works, and it is super fun! The offices were beautiful, each one furnished in a different style and use, from the individual office to co working, and auditorium. Thanks so much to everyone that came and for the team that made this possible!</p>
<p>El Colegio is available for rent! for more information: <a href="https://info.conservatoriosa.com/el-colegio-2">www.elcolegio2.com </a> or email us directly!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>After the Acobir Fair, we got inspired to write a series of articles for first home buyers. Finally we put our thoughts in order, so we´ll start publishing several blogs with our opinion on the most popular themes at the fair. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>The first one! :</p>
<p>El primero!</p>
<p><strong>House vs Apartament: Myths and Realities<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Having your own place to call home is a common, and important dream for everyone.Specially for those thinking about forming a family, to have a stable place to root or leave to the next generation, is truly a life changing investment.</p>
<p>In my case, I grew up in a house in Panama´s suburbs, with a garden, a fence, dogs, cats, a hen and at least two rabbits (which you can imagine they didn´t last too long, nor the hen&#8230;).  Yes, it was like several episodes of Animal Planet. But when the moment to buy something of my own came, I had a lot of questions.  I learned it wasn´t as simple as it looked, that this decision was tied to many other things. I also learned that there are many misconceptions about both decisions. Here, in my opinion, are some of the most important ones:</p>
<p>First, some myths about having a &#8220;house&#8221;:</p>
<p><u>It is mine and I don´t have to deal with anyone:</u> PARTIALLY TRUE.   Independence of actions and decisions is one of the most attractive things of owning a house. But you still have to deal with your neighbors, as the value of the house is tied up to the value of the neighborhood&#8230; which is made by collaboration. Many houses are also part of a condo regimen, and rules are to be followed. No one is an island!  The community I grew up with was fabulous, and looking back I realize that it was because everyone knew each other, worked together, celebrated together and helped each other out constantly.</p>
<p><u>No maintenance fee, Lower costs</u>: FALSE.  As the sole owner of the property, you have to pay 100% of the expenses of fixing anything, including stuff that in a condo would be shared with others.  Maintenance of fasade, roof, fumigation, gardens. The list goes on and on&#8230; In a house, every day is maintenance day, and absolutely everything is done by you and your checkbook.  And as in everything, proactive maintenance is the key to long term maintenance and value.</p>
<p><u>With a house I have more space and expansion capacity</u>:  TRUE,  and it comes with many hidden costs. Having space and being able to expand is very important, specially if you have a large family and pets. You also have space for multiple cars. However, this means that, depending on your budget, your options are most likely located outside the city.  This has negative consequences if the economic life of the family is in the city. It forces you to have a car (or two) with the costs it carries both in money and commuting time, which in Panama can be brutal.   The advantage of space vs  time and money has to be carefully analyzed according to each case. As I always say; the cost is always there, you need to look around and see in which currency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, what about an &#8220;apartment&#8221;:</p>
<p><u>I am not owner of the land</u>: FALSE.  Every &#8220;horizontal property&#8221; as we call condos in Panama own a percentage of the land, divided between all the owners. The most important concept in a condo is that all owners are in one boat, and everyone owns a bit of all common things.</p>
<p><u>They are too small, I won´t fit! </u>: TRUE AND FALSE.  It depends on your lifestyle. Modern apartments are compact, but they are also designed to be very efficient. You also tend to have social areas, and be centrally located near public amenities and private services, so you end up enjoying more of an outdoor lifestyle than indoors. In my case, remembering my parents house, it was a large home with areas that were never used. When I finally had to pack to move, I frankly shedded a bunch of stuff and felt awesome.  I admit this is not for everyone, and that it is not always easy, specially with children. But to have a pre conceived notion on whether you´ll fit or not without giving space to a true excercise of cleaning up (and keeping only what truly makes you happy) might be closing up what could be real options for you.</p>
<p><u>Apartments can be safer:</u> TRUE. Unless you live in a fully gated community, a house is much more vulnerable to theft. In a building, security services and systems tend to be very efficient as they are in a compact area, which makes them better and cheaper.</p>
<p>Of course, living in a condo community is not for everyone. You are in a boat with a number of people and this implies working together, rowing to the same side. And many times this can be frustrating. In a house, you feel the boat is all yours, even though it is dependent of a larger boat which is the community it is in. It is a very personal cultural calling.</p>
<p>For me, at the end, the decision of a smaller, more manageable place, close to everything, was the right one for my lifestyle. It would be hard to go back to a house. I have a wonderful 65 pound dog and my lifestyle allows me to walk her out several times a day. Another thought is that sometimes it has to do with your lifecycle, I´ve seen many young couples starting with an apartment, moving to a house when they have kids, and going back to an apartment when the kids no longer need the space.</p>
<p>What I believe is important is to have your priorities well defined and all cards on the table before making a decision!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Researching about lifestyles and what makes people happy, the other day I asked several friends what were the things that they found really had an impact in their every day lives. Here are some of their top answers:</p>
<p><u>Traffic:</u> first place! And by traffic they really are talking about Panamanian traffic, how it steals hours from their day and destroys their enjoyment of life. Presence or absence of traffic is an important part of the happiness equation, it determines if they are satisfied with being able to do all their errands easily, or go and be able to spend time with loved ones.</p>
<p><u>Living in the city center</u>: even though many still harbour the dream of a house with the white fence, when they really got thinking about what brings happiness to their day to day, it was living as centric as possible the answer to mental wellbeing.   The balancing act that is work, family and friends was made much easier. For those living in the suburbs, it was always necessary to chose, and there was only space to chose one.</p>
<p><u>Having services nearby:</u>  the best, according to my friends, was to live in a place that had a bit of everything. Not to have to jump in a car if all they needed was an aspirin, or to buy food.  Probably the aspirin was to be able to survive the traffic!  Also to have a couple of places to enjoy with their loved ones and friends. Outdoor excercise for some, or just have a beer for others. The key to happiness was to have a diversity of uses&#8230; nearby.</p>
<p>These three themes have several things in common: the lack of today´s most expensive resource: time. And a deep understanding that what makes life livable gets lost if hours are spent in a car. Experiences, relaxed conversations, laughter and spaces where we share and build with other humans.</p>
<p>As a side effect, there is also a financial benefit. Check out this article with a finantial analysis in Canada: <a href="http://www.moneyaftergraduation.com/2015/12/14/it-isnt-cheaper-to-live-in-the-suburbs/"> CLICK HERE</a></p>

<p>A phone call, a friendship, an amazing event: jazz legend Wynton Marsalis ended up playing at the American Trade Hotel in Casco Viejo after a trip to Venezuela was cancelled.</p>
<p>The famous trumpet player was touring Latin America along with 20 musicians from New York`s Lincoln Center, so he reached out to his old friend (and Grammy Award winner) Danilo Perez  to see if he could pass by and support Danilo`s Jazz School in Panama, run by the Danilo Perez Foundation.   A workshop was given at Plaza Herrera, and a concert Saturday night at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/danilosjazzclub?ref=br_tf">Danilo`s Jazz Bar</a> from the <a href="http://www.acehotel.com/panama">American Trade Hotel</a>.  This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for all the students from the Foundation, and for all jazz fans in Panama.</p>
<p>Here is the note from <a href="http://impresa.prensa.com/vivir/Musica-educacion_0_4164333681.html">La Prensa.  </a></p>
<p><a href="http://wyntonmarsalis.org/">Wynton Marsalis Website</a> , and the <a href="http://fundaciondaniloperez.org/">Danilo Perez Foundation</a> Website.  If you would like to keep in touch with events at Danilo`s Jazz Bar, this is their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/danilosjazzclub?ref=br_tf">FACEBOOK</a> page.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you wearing?&#8221; that was the classic line from Joan Rivers at the  Oscar`s Red Carpet. Well, not that I am even close, but when a friend learned that I was making this &#8220;self challenge&#8221; on wearing only Casco-bought or Casco-made clothes, she immediately said: You have to make a blog out of each outfit!</p>

<p>This year, St. Valentines is basically at the same time as carnivals. If you are a Panamanian, you know what this means: the city is going to be empty. Awesome.</p>
<p>And what a better way to celebrate an intimate weekend with your beloved one than staying in Casco. Think about it: no one will be around, you can sleep in late, walk (not take a car, ever), sunbathe at the beach or picnic there, and have a beautiful dinner at a place like Las Clementinas (<span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="hasCaption">228.7617 / events@lasclementinas.com</span></span>) , which has the most romantic garden in town.</p>
<p>A full weekend strolling hand by hand? sounds like a wonderful idea!</p>

<p>Before you restore a building in Casco Viejo, you are required to do archaeological studies.  It is fascinating to see them dig and find stuff, but even more when you ask them what does it mean.</p>
<p>Yesterday, talking to archaeologist Tomas Mendizabal, we went through some of the bags of material he was pulling out of a recent excavation.  He found out that the water well in the property was &#8220;fake&#8221; (ornamental) and that if you dig deep enough you find 19th century garbage (bones, pieces of plates and jars).  Although simple, it completes a piece in the puzzle of colonial daily life. This particular house suffered through the city`s first Big Fire, but survived the others (Casco had 3).  It is one of the oldest houses in the block.</p>
<p>We also asked him about the famous legend of the hidden &#8220;tunnels&#8221; between former churches of Casco Viejo. He says he has never bumped into them, so probably more of an urban legend than reality.  The only church that has a burial site (catacomb) is the Cathedral.</p>
<p>Archaeology is fascinating, and the work requires patience and developing an eye. Check out the things he collected for his bags! Could you have imagined they were a hundred years old?</p>

<p>Last Saturday, neighbors and members of Casco Viejo`s neighborhood association (AVACA) gathered at the Santo Domingo beach to have fun. Do beach-like things. Simply use it. And the result was nothing short of a historic event.  Remember my post about this beach being &#8220;alive&#8221; back in the 40`s? (<a href="http://arcoproperties.com/2014/08/panama-photos-1941-national-geographic-magazine/">here</a>) this was way better!</p>
<p>Check it out! and you know what the best is? you don´t need a reason or an event to go.  This is a public beach, an incredible natural resource 15 minutes away from Panama`s modern city, just steps away from your door if you live in Casco.  Just remember: be respectful, no amplified noise nor licor&#8230; and take back with you any trash that you may produce.  This is a beautiful family style beach, let`s keep the love for it high.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sarah Tyler and Casco Antiguo Spanish School for this amazing video of that day. And to Nina Tissera for putting it together, and all the community and AVACA members who made it possible!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Yoga early morning, sunbathing, reading a book, hearing the waves hit the rocks.  Play soccer at the beach or volleyball. Explore the mangroves and take a look at all the small circle of life that happens there every day.  To look at things the same you did as a child: every small detail becomes a world on its own. Build a sand castle. A sculpture to defy the tides. Throw a Frisbee to your dog. Paddle. Catch a wave.</p>
<p>All of this is possible at Casco Viejo`s beaches. And to celebrate it, Casco`s neighbors have decided to show up at the beach at Calle 3era and A Avenue to simply&#8230; use it. As a beach. To re discover it, and invite others to re discover it with them.</p>
<p>It is being called &#8220;A Day at the Bay&#8221;, and it will have several events happening on January 31st,. 7 a.m. with yoga at the sand bar, soccer leagues around 2 p.m.  There will be paddle boarding. We`ll get the schedule later this week, so keep tuned.  But the most important thing is just to show up and use the beach however you want to use it. It is public, it is yours. So come and join!</p>
<p>Meeting point: Beach at Calle 3era and 4ta, Casco Viejo. You can enter by Mostaza`s street or the one after, by Santa Familia.</p>

<p>Last weekend La Vecindad was turned into a small fair by La Libélula (the Firefly), a small group of young female designers who decided to join hands and start moving their product in a mobile format. This was their first fair, second one will be in March. I was glad to see one of the designers that sell pieces at Mamitas (and from whom I bought before).  I`m glad to see more entrepreneurship happening little by little. Thanks to La Libelula for choosing Casco and to La Vecindad for offering space!</p>

<p>342 years ago, the people of this isthmus said &#8220;enough&#8221;. Enough pirates, enough health issues, enough is enough. The city laid in ruins, and anyways it wasn´t like people had this amazing standard of living. The city needed to move, and the time was &#8220;now&#8221;.</p>
<p>January 21st is the day we celebrate the &#8220;moving&#8221; of the city, from Panama (now known as &#8220;La Vieja&#8221; or The Old) to the &#8220;new&#8221; site, alias Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>This year, the Oficina del Casco Antiguo and the Alcaldía will be doing some events: from Lottery at the Plaza Catedral to a small green market (veggies).  But for me, the most interesting one will be the talk at the Anita Villalaz Theater, where they`ll talk about the history and amazing achievement of moving the city rock by rock.</p>
<p>Here is the info:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>This is the week for 2015 predictions, so I went around asking a bit what people thought 2015 would bring both for Panama and for Casco. Since we are so focused on Casco, I reached out to my friend Kent Davis, from Panama Equity Real Estate, and he had an interesting view of the upcoming year:</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re still seeing tons of interest from foreigners looking to move to Panama.  Some are lured by the strong economy, some are fleeing political instability, and others are just seeking a new lifestyle and a new adventure.</p>
<p>I like the new administration and hope that the President and his team are able to keep Panama in the spotlight for all the right reasons.  I don’t think anyone realizes what a game changer the expanded Canal is going to be, and I like the fact that Varela has kept infrastructure improvements on the political agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have always said real estate is all about niches. Panama on its own is a niche within a region. And within Panama, Casco Viejo as a historic city is a niche within a niche. Asking around residents and businesses on what they thought 2015 would bring to Casco,  two words came up: Community and Stability.</p>
<p>And they made a lot of sense.</p>
<p>If you`ve been following Casco, you might remember that 2013 was a year where all the streets where under construction, which made it difficult for everyone, specially businesses. 2014 saw the end of this project, but being also Presidential Election year, it was just not a typical one. Finally, 2015 is coming,  and now everything seems to be in place for everyone to stabilize and grow. For those who had visited the Casco during the last two years will notice the difference. Developers are submitting plans that were left in the oven during the Election time, so hopefully we`ll see some great projects being approved to start building and pre selling during 2014.</p>
<p>Also we`ve started to see a trend with new small non profit organizations and grass root groups starting to bring their energy to specific issues and areas.  I`m a big fan of empowerment, so I am particularly excited about it!</p>
<p>Hope this blog gave you a good idea on why Panama and why Casco for 2015.  We don´t have a crystal ball, but we believe that whenever strong fundamentals like uniqueness, strong community and stability are present, you have a wonderful recipe for long term value far beyond 2015.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy the holidays!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Antiguo, Casco Viejo</p>
<p>For some years now, Casco`s neighborhood association <a href="http://www.avaca.org.pa/">AVACA</a> has been actively working on recycling in Casco.  It has a recycling program called Casco Recicla, which picks up material from residents and businesses every Wednesday.  It also coordinates beach cleanings per month and does educational events.</p>
<p>This Christmas, <a href="http://www.avaca.org.pa/">AVACA</a> joined hands with the children`s program <a href="http://www.aprojusan.org/">APROJUSAN </a>and the social reintegration program <a href="http://fundacioncalicanto.org/en/programs/esperanza/">Esperanza</a>  from <a href="http://fundacioncalicanto.org/">Fundacion Calicanto</a> to do a fun activity: create Christmas trees out of plastic bottles picked from the beach or from Casco Recicla.</p>
<p>Yesterday, aided by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ecocreando">Fundacion Eco Creando</a>, all of them worked together into creating the first tree. This tree will be exhibited at 4th Street, and the Esperanza students will replicate what they`ve learned into a second tree for the street where they live by Calle 9na.  The goal is to have a total of 3 trees, the third one towards Plaza Herrera by calle 12.</p>
<p>Each tree requires each team to: pick up recycling material from the street or beach, clean it up, prepare and team work until done. It is a beautiful small project with long lasting teachings and great message. Each tree will be in place until January 6th, and hopefully visited and photographed by everyone in the community or visiting!</p>
<p>Here are the photos of the &#8220;making&#8221; of Tree One. Still not finished, so keep tuned!</p>

<p>I have a special attachment to Las Clementinas. Why? A piece of my history is there.</p>
<p>I think my grandmother`s old armoire must be over 70 years if not more. In Panama, where wood furniture (and wood anything) takes a beating with the mix of humid climate plus the number of insects yet unknown to science that tend to consider wood the equivalent of three cheese pizza, you really amaze at furniture that manages to survive such a long time.  Plus, consider this armoire spent at least 50 years living at the beach with all its deliciously salty air.  It survived us as little kids hiding inside, playing hide and seek. The whole house crumbled years ago (it was made out of wood), but the armoire stood tall, like a monolith in a Stanley Kubrick movie.</p>
<p>To take it back to civilization was a fascinating process. The furniture was made to be assembled without nails, just placing the joints in an elegant,  perfect fit. To be taken apart (to &#8220;move&#8221;, in Spanish the word for furniture is &#8220;mueble&#8221;, something mobile) and travel with it, probably by horse. This time it made its trip back to the city in a Toyota Hi Lux.</p>
<p>I thought it would be a nightmare to put it back together, that it would be fragile and break immediately. But it was really easy. Almost like magic, it came back to life, with a little bit of love and oil, good as new. No nonsense, resilient, elegant. Just like grandma.</p>
<p>Where is it right now? Stay at Las Clementinas and find out!</p>

<p>Open! also this week, Farmacias Revilla made its debut in Casco Viejo.  This pharmacy is one of the main pharmacies in Panama, and the small locale has its signature: you will be able to find professional care plus great options on creams, shampoos and even small gifts. Located at the corner of A Ave and 1st street.</p>
<p>I met Eric, who was in charge and told me the pharmacy will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. during weekdays, and a bit later on weekends (until 10 p.m.).  If you are living in Casco and have a list of medicines and vitamins you need, email them at cascoviejo@farmaciasrevilla.com   Their phone is: 207-1839.</p>
<p>Farmacias Revilla also does delivery, although this is not managed by the specific local in Casco Viejo. Their Revilla Express service can be contacted at 225-0555.</p>
<p>And here is their <a href="http://www.farmaciasrevilla.com/">WEBSITE.  Welcome!</a></p>

<p>Casco has its own COPA Airlines office! they opened this week, right beside the American Trade Hotel.  From there you`ll be able to buy tickets, it is the classic sales office. They`ll be open from Monday to Friday, from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. All sales will be in person, no phone nor email.  This office will be specially useful for all Casqueño retirees who would like to access to the discounted rates. Usually their procedures require the person showing up physically at one of their offices. Well, now you only have to walk down the street!</p>

<p>I really like how retail has started to show up in Casco. Little by little!  This week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lido-Isle-Boutique/612090192140000">Lido Isle Boutique </a>opened at Casa Remon`s groundfloor.  Owned by Douglas Johnson and his sister Teri, it is all about casual and beach wear. Right on time for all the beach stuff that is happening lately with TLGym`s paddle board movement! (did I hear surf shop coming soon? yes&#8230; keep tuned!)  Great colors, easy going fabrics, it is all about how you wear it.  Fun accessories!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>This is what happens when you live in Casco Viejo and are plugged into all the community ngo`s that work here:</p>
<p>Saturday morning: beach cleaning! help gather material to build a fantastic Christmas Tree with volunteers from the Casco Viejo neighborhood association (<a href="http://www.avaca.org.pa/">AVACA</a>) while helping the environment. Do good in no time: 8 a.m. until 9:30 a.m.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8258.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9755" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8258-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_8258" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8258-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8258.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8260.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9756" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8260-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_8260" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8260-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8260.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The fun continues: run home, get changed and ready for brunch at the <a href="http://www.acehotel.com/panama">American Trade Hall</a> for a family event.  Really nice food, after the beach cleaning, my body welcomes all the calories, including gummy bears.</p>

<p>Go home, nap, walk the dog, work on your urban garden.</p>
<p>4 p.m. Get ready for the <a href="http://festivalprisma.com/el-festival/about-the-festival/?lang=en">PRISMA contemporary</a> dance festival, go to a super interesting performance by French troup at the Kiwanis gym in Chorrillo.  Burn calories just from looking at them. Amazing.</p>

<p>Back from PRISMA, I realize it is the &#8220;Lobato Day&#8221; for the Scouts, the whole gang is gathered by the basketball field at Santa Familia doing activities and games to celebrate. Children everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Scouts-Casco-Viejo-Panama.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9764" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Scouts-Casco-Viejo-Panama-300x225.jpg" alt="Scouts Casco Viejo Panama" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Scouts-Casco-Viejo-Panama-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Scouts-Casco-Viejo-Panama.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Sunday: wake up, walk the dog to <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a> and have brunch there. They`ve started to offer on Sundays Venezuelan breakfast. Chef Paula is from Venezuela, and she missed her home made food, so she started cooking and the trend started growing. I`m an arepa fan, so we ordered Reina Pepiada and huevos pericos with caraotas (black beans).  After that, lazy Sunday took over, the perfect scenario to read and relax. I`m kind of sad I missed the Dog Fashion Show at Cinta Costera at 2 p.m.  Next time!</p>

<p>I`ts been under construction forever, and just a few months ago they started opening their doors as in a soft opening.  We decided to go try their restaurant, so went for lunch. What a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p>Their octopus appetizer was a full meal, and a delicious one.  We tried also their soup, excellent.  We couldn´t visit the rooms as they were still undergoing changes, but the manager said they will try and be open for high season.</p>

<p>Curated by our friend and neighbor Ramón Zafrani (alias Monchi), this artshow is at Casa Soldado, run by the Spanish Agency of Cooperation.  The show is small but deep: the eternal questions of identity and what progress means dealt with beauty and humor. I particularly liked the pieces by Pilar, which reminded me of those Facebook posts where someone jokes about &#8220;what your friends think you do, what your mother thinks you do, what you think you do, what you actually do&#8221;.  Can´t miss it!</p>

<p>Friday night we had a lovely time at Diablo Rosso`s Poetry Jam. The place was packed, and different people read or performed their poems in different styles. From rap to street to a more classic rhythm,  from serious to funny,  it was a wonderful night I hope it gets its way through Diablo`s weekly programming.</p>
<p>Plus: great food!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>A classic Casco Viejo Sunday: walk my dog early around 7 ish, and down the street two neighbors singing and dancing.  They were so funny improvising I had to take a video and upload it to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10152302119845911&amp;set=vb.522965910&amp;type=2&amp;theater">Facebook. </a>But then, in the afternoon, a friend called me &#8220;hey! concert in Plaza Catedral,!&#8221;. So I run there and a group of students from La Chorrera had their band playing. After, the SPI band followed with tons of salsa, and the whole plaza became a dancing floor. The kids were fantastic, their spirit got contagious, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10152304872735911&amp;set=vb.522965910&amp;type=2&amp;theater">everyone started dancing after them. </a></p>
<p>And you know what is the best about this? that this type of stuff happens all the time here. You wouldn´t be able to plan ahead for this. You can only live it by living in it. Awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.danzaactivapanama.com/">Danza Activa</a> is a dance competition that has been around now for about 5 years in Panama. Last year it had about 300 participants including dancers from Mexico, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and the United States.</p>
<p><a href="http://fundacioncalicanto.org/programas/enlaces/">&#8220;Enlaces&#8221;</a> is the dance program from Fundación Calicanto, that through dance opens doors to a different world and in doing so prevents crime with children from high risk areas. It is all about education and prevention, a big component on self esteem.</p>
<p>The program now has a couple of years running with quiet success. Some of their students have already participated in performances such as Nutcracker shoulder to shoulder with professional dancers from Panama`s National Ballet. Having a group of them competing this year with other dancers at Danza Activa is an amazing achievement.</p>
<p>Our congratulations to the Enlaces team at Fundación Calicanto!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>Have you ever heard: &#8220;can´t find parking in Casco&#8221;, &#8220;had to park on top of a sidewalk&#8221;, &#8220;parked on a corner and got my car scratched&#8221; (if not more).</p>
<p>Every day, visitors in Casco jump through hoops to get parking. And yet, there is a full parking building in the old town. What`s the catch? absolutely nothing: just no one is aware that it even exists. When pointed, most people go &#8220;ahhhh!&#8221; . So I`m hereby sharing the secret spot: Plaza Herrera.</p>
<p>How to get to the parking building: if you are coming from Cinta Costera and going up the ramp into San Felipe, just keep to your right and drive straight towards Plaza Herrera. Do not deviate. Keep straight. You`ll see a yellow building on the corner, fully restored. Behind it, you`ll see a very shy blue sign with a big &#8220;E&#8221; which in Spanish stands for ESTACIONAMIENTO (a.i. parking).</p>
<p>Right now is for free, so no excuses. Fully guarded, brand new, parking building.  You don´t need to pay anyone here. Can´t promise it will be forever &#8220;for free&#8221; as taxes pay only up to so much. But even once you start paying, you`ll car be off the street, well situated and secure. Easy to reach, easy to leave from.</p>
<p>Now you know!!!! so please, please, don´t park on the streets on top of sidewalks and corners. And if you are coming for events, don´t forget there is also Casco Parking. This is a private company that also has secure lots inside Casco.  More on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cascoparking">Casco Parking HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a map with a bonus on how to get to Arco Properties:</p>

<p>Coming back to Panama from a recent trip, we stopped at Albuquerque and hit some antique stores. You won´t believe my surprise when I found in a pile of old National Geographic magazines, an article about Panama. The year was 1941. I simply loved it. Since today we are celebrating the foundation of &#8220;Panama La Vieja&#8221;, I thought it would be a good moment to put these out there!</p>
<p>Plaza Santa Ana</p>

<p>The Golden Frog is a symbol of national pride but also a source of preoccupation on our scientific and environmentalist community. The frog only exists in El Valle, Panama, and walks the tight rope of extinction.</p>
<p>Efforts have been made to reproduce it in captivity (successful!) but tons of work still lies ahead. The good part is that the &#8220;frog team&#8221; is highly motivated. Some years ago, they created the Golden Frog Festival, and every year they do several activities to fund raise for research and conservation.</p>
<p>Today, they`ll be at the American Trade Hotel with an interesting talk. Here is the info:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>1914 was a special year for Panama. It was the inauguration of the Panama Canal. You would think that such an amazing wonder would have attracted the best of the best around the world to come and see it. But no. No one showed up. The main reason was:Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed and by July 2014 World War I had exploded. The Panama Canal was inaugurated in August.</p>
<p>A hundred years later, Panama looks back to commemorate one of the Seven Wonders of the World. On this topic, Fundacion Calicanto has decided to give a twist: what if the Archduke had survived the bullet? what if the world had never entered the war? who would have shown up for the inauguration party?</p>
<p>So, answers will &#8220;show up&#8221; during their creative fundraising Gala on September 3rd.  The whole theme will be around the historic Hotel Tivoli (someone donated an original menu!) and the night promises to be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>But the best part? all proceeds go to their programs, which include women empowerment, children`s education and social reintegration for Casco Viejo`s young men. While the night might be creative and full of fantasy, do know it is all about building a very real, long term, world of peace.</p>
<p>If you would like to assist, please let us know! patrizia@arcoproperties.com</p>
<p>To learn about their programs:https://www.youtube.com/user/FundacionCalicanto</p>
<p>Here is their invitation to the party:</p>

<p>On the 6th of June a neighbor sent us a photo with the mother laying the eggs. We were not sure if she had done it, though, as she was already leaving. But today, 65 days later&#8230; the beautiful gift of life!</p>
<p>Another neighbor saw them coming out and helped them to reach the water. Now we have the whole thing documented! it is amazing when you give nature a chance to recover. Let`s keep protecting and caring for our oceans, specially urban beaches like the ones in Casco. We need those reminders that we are not alone, we do share this world with others.</p>

<p>For third year in a row, the architectural firm Hache Uve has won a Premio Magna given by the Panamanian Architecture and Engineer Association. This time, the awarded building was Casa Vidal, a residential project located at 1st Street in San Felipe, Casco Viejo.  Congratulations to everyone involved! restoring a building in Casco is not a one man show. From land owners to designers, to builders and project managers, there are thousands of hours put into a single unit.</p>
<p>Here is Hache Uve`s page on the project: <a href="http://hacheuve.com/en/proyectos/casa-vidals/">CLICK HERE.</a></p>
<p>And here is a small video with photos of the building:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Loved street birthday parties. One of my earliest memories was hitting a piñata so hard I broke the wooden stick, which ended up hitting an adult several feet away. Hey, no one told him to be that close! Then there is another one, where a piñata finally broke and candies fell from the sky and somehow all of a sudden it was ok to jump in there and grab as much as you could, by force if you needed to. Awesome. But in today`s world, when was the last time you saw a street birthday party? well, actually Saturday in Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>It is such a teasing game. The adults at the top raise and lower the piñata so the baby or the kid can´t get it too easily. But eventually they do, sometimes the adult gave them the opportunity, sometimes (with older kids) they totally had to earn it.  And when the treasure falls down, you can imagine what`s next. Chaos, tears, laughter. And then dance and sharing. Food comes, mothers are on top of everything and everyone sing the famous song, in English first and Spanish later with some salsa tempo and a bonus track about ice cream. Cultural note here: you can´t escape the singing part, even when you are a full grown up, suit and tie adult. You will sing Feliz Cumpleaños. If you are not used to it, my best advice is just to own it!</p>
<p>So here it is: the birthday party we bumped into on Saturday after the Esperanza Tour at Fortaleza. Loved the little kid&#8230; so serious, he was swinging like pro baseball player!</p>

<p>If you are looking for a unique gift to take home, something Panamanian but sophisticated, that was not only made in Casco but helps directly communities improve their quality of life you have two beautiful choices: Papiro y Yo and Karavan.</p>
<p>Papiro y Yo works mainly with communities in the interior, towards Penonomé and what we call the &#8220;dry arch&#8221;.  Karavan works with the indigenous communities and with the African descendants that live in Portobelo. Between the two you cover a big part of Panama`s cultural rainbow!</p>
<p>While part of their production is at those communities, they also produce &#8220;in house&#8221;. Here is the info on each one:</p>
<p>Papiro y Yo: located at 4th Street, betwen Central Avenue and B Avenue, entering by Casa Góngora or if you are at Plaza Bolivar entering by Casablanca.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PapiroyYo">Here is their FACEBOOK page. </a></p>

<p>I`m liking this &#8220;Made in Casco&#8221; concept every day more. It is allowing me to see this neighborhood differently and discovering cool stuff.</p>
<p>For years,  I had seen neighbor Mitchelle Quiñones with the most interesting jewelry on her. Never asked where she got it, until this past week when she told me she had a workshop in Casco and was producing her own line from there. Fantastic!</p>
<p>She has her own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mitchelle.quinones.7?fref=ts&amp;ref=br_tf">Facebook Page</a> and is starting to promote her brand. Check it out!</p>

<p>I couldn´t believe it. I was in a line (and a long one!) to get into Teatro Amador. But it wasn´t the latest concert of the latest celebrity. We were all there to assist to TEDx Panama City, and the conversation was to be about culture and identity.</p>
<p>We had a blast. From the bizarre to the concrete, speakers brought a broad spectrum, but everything related to education, cultural manifestations, cultural projects, cultural reflections and meditations.  It closed with Panamanian saxophonist Yahaziel Arrocha playing his own interpretation of Suspiros de una Fea and with spoken poetry by the Congo community from Portobelo.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate the team that made this possible, specially to Alfonso Grimaldo. Paraphrasing TED`s moto, I think these are passions worth spreading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo.</p>
<p>Checking out old adds from Panama “way back when”, I had a to smile on the sort of items you would find in the stores. Mainly fabrics, oils, leather, lace and other primary goods. Other adds would be for shoemakers, tailors ,pharmacies that knew how to mix herbs , seamstresses that were able to make a wedding dress from scratch and keep her work discreet so her clients could boast they had brought the dress “from Europe”.</p>
<p>It is true that our world has lost touch with those old trades. However, a new generation of artisans/artists have moved in and opened shop in Casco.  From fashion to food &amp; beverage, all of them creative minds, creative hands. Not sure if they`ve gotten recognized yet, but just in case, I`m making my own series called “Made in Casco”.</p>
<p>Being half Italian I have to start with pasta: “Casco Made Pasta”: fresh pasta made at restaurant Da Vinci. Owned by Juan and Zummy, the pasta is made by María, who has been working with the couple for twelve years and was trained by Juan. They extend the “home made” approach to everything in their kitchen, but they are the only ones making, packaging and selling their own pasta.</p>
<p>Where is Da Vinci? You`ll find them just coming up the hill entering San Felipe. Look to your right, they`ll be there almost next to Luna`s Castle.</p>
<p>How to contact them? Phones: 262-6285  262-8974</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Saturday I went to an Acro Yoga workshop (my first time!). Some might know I´ve been practicing yoga on and off for a while, so Maya recommended the workshop. I really enjoyed it! it was super fun and challenging at the same time. But strangely, even if the photos below look super difficult, they were not. As my former ballet teacher would have said, it is more technique than strenght.</p>
<p>At the ended up taking photos of everyone and not of myself, so here are the best ones. Casco Yoga has several workshops coming, from Mindfulness to a weekend retreat. Here are the links to both Casco Yoga Panama and Acro Yoga if you would like to find out more:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past weekend, Casco Viejo´s kinder had a beautiful bazar. The purpose was to fundraise for the scholarship program that will allow children from Casco´s community to attend. This school is a Montessori school and we are so proud of it. Has grown little by little, literally from the houses of parents who believed in educating their children in a different way and in Casco´s environment. Now, they have a small building, with different classrooms, and a dedicated group of teachers.  The day was awesome. Everyone came to support, and old friends met new friends!</p>
<p>If you are interested in the school, please contact Keren Levanon at: 6444-7452</p>

<p>The chocolate factory Oro Moreno, has re branded their space as a delicious and delightful café. Went the other day and since then, I haven´t stopped bringing my friends and family. The quiche was delicious, and they serve it with a nice little salad. They have soups and crepes. Located on 6th street, entering by Espresso Americano and in front of La Sexta!</p>
<p>It is pet friendly, and no worries if you go by yourself&#8230; you´ll always have good company! =)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>31 Actually. And in a historic building with more than 800 mt2 of office space on the top.  How?</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that developer <a href="https://www.conservatoriosa.com/">Conservatorio</a> (our mother company) has brought what is the first mechanized parking system to Panama.  This system, by the German company <a href="http://www.klausparking.com/">Klaus Multiparking</a> is simply put, the future, not only for Casco Viejo but for Panama City.</p>
<p>The system is part of El Colegio, Casco´s first Grade A office building, opening in May 2018. Open office floorplans, high ceilings, balcony, roof terrace with stunning views&#8230; and parking.  With 40 years of experience in building this type of systems, we are very proud to be the first ones in Panama, and to make this statement from Casco Viejo. Cities grow, and spaces have to get more compact and efficient. New solutions have to be applied, and technology has proven to be a critical ally.  For years, Conservatorio has been leading the market through sustainable urban revitalization, seeking and applying solutions to complex urban challenges using creativity, and out of the box ideas to tackle problems.</p>
<p>El Colegio is the perfect corner for small to medium businesses in the creative , cultural or technological business.  Family offices and even small educational institutions.</p>
<p>For more information, take a look at <a href="https://info.conservatoriosa.com/el-colegio-2">our microsite : HERE</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A school library might seem something most take for granted, but for most public schools in Panama it is a challenge to keep up looking fresh and with new material (hopefully in two languages!). That is why we were super excited to be invited by <a href="https://cascospanish.com/blog/">Casco Antiguo´s Spanish School</a> to the inauguration of the newly refurbished library at the Escuela de México. Casco´s Spanish School took the initiative along with their students, parents of Escuela de México and teachers to re paint and make the library more functional. Children were smiling, all happy to see the old space with a new face and new books!</p>
<p>Now that it is done, if you have books you would like to donate, you can bring them to Casco´s Spanish School at A Avenue and 5th street, and they´ll make sure to take them to the school.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone who made this possible, I don´t know the name of everyone involved, specially the donor who made a wonderful &#8220;Spanglish&#8221; speech! Thanks to David to make it happen and for the invitation to be there at the inauguration.</p>

<p>Love how the Theater Festival FAE and the Fashion/Arts Festival MACRO cluster in March. It gives us the right mood for the whole month, and a great preparation for the Film Festival (IFF) coming in April. I couldn´t catch the whole thing, so here are only a few photos of some of their interventions at Plaza Santa Ana, Plaza Catedral and A Avenue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Casco Viejo`s community came together to help a large number of families victim to an accidental fire. In a matter of hours, lists and donations were organized, by 6 a.m. on the following day a team was in place with tasks, headquarters and social media strategies.  It made me think a lot about Casco Viejo, and its true value. The value of a place is tied up to its community, to its ability to work together and get through difficult times when things get tough. Somehow this doesn´t make it to the &#8220;real estate&#8221; analysis, but it should, because striped from  high end finishes, double panned windows, nice facades and sidewalks, what really matters is the strength of the human web that not only connects physically in the same space and time&#8230; but feels connected to each other.</p>
<p>The strength of Casco are its Casconians. And note that by Casconians I mean every Casco lover out there, we are all connected, and this trial was the real proof of it: people came from everywhere to help. Thank you so much to each and every one of you. To the NGO`s who were coordinating and working their heads off: Aprojusan, <a href="http://www.fundacioncalicanto.org/">Fundación Calicanto</a>, AVACA. Amazing. To all the businesses that didn´t even flinch in pulling out their contacts and see who knew who so that we could get what we needed. Super Thumbs Up.  To all the volunteers &#8230; you rock!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>5:58 a.m. and I already feel my dog`s axiety rising. She knows my alarm goes off at 6 a.m. but still starts stretching at 5:30 ish letting me know she won´t allow for a minute past 6 a.m. to go out.  Don´t get me wrong, I love working out in the mornings, but just in case there is ever a day I don´t want to do it&#8230; well, there is always Chispa.</p>
<p>This time I decided to take photos along the way, for those considering moving to Casco and asking themselves about gyms and options to keep fit. Most Casconians love to be outdoors.  In the morning, you see people walking Las Bovedas, but if you like jogging probably you`ll be heading to the Cinta.</p>
<p>6:10 a.m. I`m ready, leach in hand with plenty of bags, we are out. First stop, the &#8220;cancha&#8221; by the Presidential palace. Already the Presidential police is having fun, playing soccer or sometimes basketball.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/football-or-basketball.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9166" alt="football or basketball" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/football-or-basketball-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/football-or-basketball-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/football-or-basketball-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Some of them have decided to work out at the Plaza V Centenario, right below.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/police-training.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9167" alt="police training" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/police-training-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/police-training-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/police-training-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I was too early, but usually around 6:30 a.m. you can see some people practicing Tai Chi here</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tai-chi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9168" alt="tai chi" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tai-chi-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tai-chi-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tai-chi-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>For those who like tenis, a small jog or 10 minute walk will warm you up:</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tenis.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9169" alt="tenis" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tenis-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tenis-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tenis-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/off-to-tenis.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9170" alt="off to tenis" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/off-to-tenis-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/off-to-tenis-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/off-to-tenis-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>And for those who like light equipment, right next to the tenis field:</p>

<p>6:39 a.m., after walking, jogging and dragging my dog &#8230;I`m back at Calle 4ta.  Enough cardio, it is time to get serious. TLG Gym is at the end of the street, into the Santa Familia building.  Here John has a crossfit training for the morning and also does personal training. No machines and no need for them!  Kettlebells, weights, strings, ropes, medicine balls, boxing and jiu jitsu equipment.  Twenty minutes of any of that and you have earned your breakfast!</p>

<p>There was a lot happening this weekend, I`m sorry I couldn´t go to everything. From what I did manage to get to, here were my top picks:</p>
<p>The urbanism talk at American Trade Hotel on how social housing can regenerate societies.  I was glad to learn that there are several ongoing projects in Panama trying to apply the concepts discussed in the talk. All based on human scale, not on &#8220;car scale&#8221;. As in our beloved Casco!</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_6114.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9130" alt="IMG_6114" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_6114-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_6114-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_6114-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The recycling art at MACRO. Yes, everyone came for the fashion, I came for the garbage&#8230; Really loved the plastic bottle sculptures at the park! Turtles, dolphins, capibaras and more out of water plastic bottles. Heard San Francisco (USA) banned them? What a bold step! we do need some inspiration&#8230;</p>
<p>There was also Jonathan Harker`s &amp; Donna Conlon`s video called &#8220;Domino Effect&#8221;. It was cleverly projected at the side of La Merced Church, where people gathered to enjoy it.  Have to say, it has an hypnotizing effect! It will be one of the pieces traveling soon to be shown at Art Basel, Miami.</p>

<p>After crazy carnivals, there is nothing like a quiet moment. If you are lucky, Nature will give you the gift of being right under a blooming Guayacan and shower you with yellow and pink flowers.  Knowing that this tree only blooms once a year and the flowers last only a week, makes that time in place even more special.</p>

<p>What a crazy Friday! here are the photos of Casco`s first Kids Carnival. It was organized by residents, businesses and a regional group called Cali 7 with members who traveled from Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica to participate.  Thanks to all AVACA members who participated, and specially to Gisela Timmins, Dayanara and Miriam who worked so hard to put it together.  And to the businesses who donated to make this happen: Las Clementinas, Arco Properties, Conservatorio S.A., Casco Station (hope not be forgetting anyone!). Thanks also to Gio from Aprojusan and for the dynamic group of the dance program Enlaces from Fundacion Calicanto.  My favorite part, though, was the one organized by John at the TLG Gym&#8230;Fantastic!!!</p>

<p>And the whole country goes into a hiatus, nothing gets done, and we are proud of it. Time to celebrate and wear strange costumes. But my favorite new tradition is the children`s carnival at Casco Viejo, which will start today at 2:30 p.m. in Santa Familia, 4th Street.   Can´t wait to sack race and run holding a spoon in my mouth with a lime on top. Wait a minute&#8230; wasn´t that for children? hummm&#8230;</p>

<p>For years, we`ve been faced with the same situation: young entrepreneurs desperately looking for office space in Casco Viejo, only to end up in an apartment or expensive ground floor commercial locale.  For all of them, great news!  Casco Viejo is turning another milestone: its first Office Building. Welcome El Colegio.</p>
<p>The property used to be the &#8220;María Inmaculada&#8221; school for women only (back then), therefore its name &#8220;El Colegio&#8221;.  The school later moved out of Casco and now the building is being restored into cool offices using the original floors and keeping charming features like the internal garden with the original mosaic of the &#8220;Inmaculada&#8221;.  Currently under construction, first offices will be delivered May  2014.</p>
<p>The full project will involve two buildings, the first one already available and almost ready to deliver 12 office units and a large commercial space. The property will have access to private parking managed by Casco Parking.   An unprecedented 448 mt2 groundfloor retail and café space will be available for those with an interesting concept that will bring value to Casco Viejo and cater the needs of the office compound.</p>
<p>For rent only! if you are interested, please contact us at :</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I joined Felix McFresh and his friend Alberto on an interesting city tour of Chorrillo. These two &#8220;chorrilleros&#8221; are passionate about their neighborhood and the special things that can only be found there as part of our historic and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Chorrillo is known today as a low income town, which has struggled all its life. While this might be so, it is also true that  Chorrillo has an intimate connection with Panama`s history and that there is plenty of good stuff to see and learn.</p>
<p>The neighborhood was known initially as the living quarters of the workers of the Panama Canal. It does hold the key for our history before that: its name means &#8220;little water stream&#8221;, which referred to the small fresh water river that ran from Ancon Hill down to this field, and where  people in Casco Viejo back in colonial times would go to source water.  The river is almost gone, in itself a lesson of how cities erase our natural history. Should we ignore this? made me meditate a lot about what growth happens on top of things and resources.</p>
<p>Considered &#8220;outside the city&#8221;, this is where the cemetery is located. All of our greatest historic figures are buried there. Some you might know only because of the references on names of streets and monuments. For example, the beautiful paseo covered by flowers that takes you to Las Bovedas is called Paseo Esteban Huertas. I &#8220;bumped into him&#8221; at Chorrillo. There was also a big pavilion for the Amador Guerrero family, him being Panama`s first President.  It is also fun to scout for foreign names and years. I wondered what was the story behind everyone, and was surprised to find that many of the sculptures were made in Italy!</p>
<p>You also bump into old traditions that refuse to die. There is the last guy who knows and actually uses a Heidelberg printer. Fascinating machine. Original! Then there is the hat guy, who will fit any hat to your personalized size. And the tailor, who in a small shop where you barely fit, can make you a custom made Guayabera shirt.  He has dressed Presidents, famous boxers and made costumes for movies.</p>
<p>Roaming around Calle 8, we passed by the famous fried fish corner. And who do we bump into? Roberto &#8220;Mano de Piedra&#8221; Durán, having a couple of beers with his friends.</p>
<p>If you have an adventurous heart, and would love to know more about the popular roots of Panama, this tour is for you. Felix is not bilingual, but can arrange for a translator. Contact him at: 6152-9013.</p>

<p>People keep opening spaces to art in Casco Viejo, this time by Miguel Lombardo, right on top of Dodo at Las Bovedas in Plaza Francia. Welcome &#8220;Casasola&#8221;!</p>
<p>The space is featuring right now two art projects, one called &#8220;Ferretería Internacional&#8221; and the other one re creates an old style pharmacy. For Ferretería, the artist took furniture from an old hardware store and re created furniture almost like a sculpture. The specific hardware store he was re creating actually existed, and he got original pieces from the family who still owned a bunch of stuff. The result is beautiful, it makes you feel like a kid in a candy store: wanting to touch everything.</p>
<p>Likewise, the &#8220;pharmacy&#8221; section also re created this type of store which back in the 20`s could very well sell you a cough remedy next to gun powder and lace. Miguel got the accounting books, which are in themselves pieces of art: you can almost trace the love put by the accountant in tracing every word and number. No one writes like that anymore! not one mistake, each line clean and clear.</p>
<p>To visit the space and get a tour of the pieces, please contact Miguel at 228-9105. Email: miguel@casasola.cc  www.casasola.cc</p>

<p>The life of a diplomat is to travel every four years (or less, depending on the country) from country to country, spreading good will on each one. Their range of experiences on places to live and work is enormous.</p>
<p>Today, at La Prensa, there was a note about French Ambassador Hugues Goisbault leaving soon, but not before praising his lifestyle in Casco Viejo. According to the note, he will have &#8220;strong memories&#8221; from Casco Viejo, where he &#8220;felt part of the neighborhood, protected&#8221;.  He recalled fondly how children in the plaza knew him, and how it was to work at the French Embassy located at Las Bovedas (French Plaza).</p>
<p>Would like to thank him for such heart felt words, and hopefully he`ll be back soon!  Here is the <a href="http://www.prensa.com/impreso/panorama/%C2%B4au-beau-fixe%C2%B4/271910">full La Prensa</a> note (in Spanish).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>During 2012, a group of Generation Peace Academy volunteers came to Casco Viejo to work with Casco`s neighborhood Association (AVACA) in an  important awareness program about garbage disposal and direct street intervention.  This year, they joined hands again to work on recycling, the natural next step.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, a survey of how much recycling material is being produced at restaurants is being made. Additionally, GPA volunteers are working with children from the community (Aprojusan) doing beach cleanings and building an herbs garden that will help local restaurants to have native species grown in house, and more involved in educational programs about nutrition for the community.</p>
<p>We are very proud of the work done by Generation Peace Academy, Aprojusan and all the members of AVACA involved in the activities. Step by step, Casco is moving towards its dream of being one of the greatest historic cities in the world, not only because of its architecture, but because of the love of its people.</p>
<p>Thanks again guys! you rock!</p>

<p>Welcome to the year of the &#8220;wooden horse&#8221;! Year 4712 according to the Chinese calendar, and this particular symbol refers to optimism and joy. Today, Panama`s Chinese community starts celebrating today (and for the next 15 days) with music, fireworks, dance and traditional rituals. Today, sponsored by the Chinese business community, they`ll have a special show at the Figali Center starting at 2 p.m.  (for free) with dance, acrobats and highlights of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>If this is your first Año Nuevo Chino in Panama, you might notice that the first &#8220;China Town&#8221; is still in Casco Viejo, so probably this weekend will be a festive scenario by B Avenue. This community, however, has extended and have now their stronghold in El Dorado, where most activities are traditionally held.<br />
One of the things people are surprised about when coming to Panama is how much Panamanians love dim sum or &#8220;Chinese breakfast&#8221;. Usually you have to fight your way through the most respected restaurants such as Lung Fung and Golden Unicorn. I bet this Sunday will be extra special, so if you are thinking on going, be there early!</p>
<p>To everyone celebrating this weekend: happy Wooden Horse Year!</p>

<p>Tuesday, the Casco Viejo Neighborhood Association (AVACA) organized a fundraising event to raise funds for its recycling program. The event was at Nuratti, a small but chic hotel in Casco Viejo. The event was a silent auction of art pieces made with material from the recycling center and themes about nature. There were also a couple of interactive pieces, where the public was able to participate creating a map of Panama with bottle caps and a tower of gliding paint.</p>
<p>The event was super fun and a success! The program will be able to buy the initial equipment to start recollecting recycling material from homes and restaurants in Casco Viejo.  More coming soon, as so much is needed. We would like to thank specially organizers Ingrid Moore, Tarina Rodriguez and Jennifer Hotsko.  Hotel Nuratti for donating the space and artists Jorge Suanzes and Alejandra Tabares for donating their beautiful work. Loved the chandelier!</p>
<p>Congratulations to all!</p>

<p>Calle Doce (12th Street) is starting to get some interesting activities! One of my favorite spots, behind the Escuela de Estados Unidos by the Masonic Lodge, has opened a music venue called &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Buat-Panam%C3%A1/260081674150278">La Buat</a>&#8220;, a word game for La Boite, the old dancing discos that back in the 50`s would play Caribbean music such as Soka and Calypso.</p>
<p>On Thursday, January 30th, they`ll have a concert by Carlos Mendez, a Panamanian musician that lived in Mexico and is now back in town. Go check it out! here is the info:</p>

<p>For months I saw artists Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker rescuing old bricks that were being replaced in Casco Viejo. Carrying them in buckets and then by cart, piling them without giving anything away. Last January 16th, in Diablo Rosso, we could see the final product: their piece &#8220;Domino Effect&#8221; portrays the bricks falling (or pushing?) through the whole Casco, in a commentary on how the city of Panama is changing, and how Casco Viejo &#8211; a World Heritage Site &#8211; has fought to keep its authenticity.</p>
<p>The bricks &#8220;walk you&#8221; through Casco, in a very zen way, with humor and love, with poetry. Someone said that at the end you felt those bricks were your friends, and maybe he was right.</p>
<p>Please pass by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DiabloRosso/media_set?set=a.10153775699640571.1073741846.601900570&amp;type=1">Diablo Rosso and check it out</a>. They have the video and also the photographic show. Kudos to both Jonathan and Donna! the question remains&#8230; what are you going to do with your &#8220;friends&#8221; now?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>I`m excited about Casco`s restaurants raising the bar in the City. Last week, Fish Market got featured in the magazine 9 -80, and the American Trade Restaurant opened doors featuring great stuff. This week I wanted to catch up and feature Donde José, a different type of restaurant that has just opened doors and is worth mentioning for many reasons.</p>
<p>First, there is the food. You`d think talking about restaurants, this should always go first, but so many times it is not. I`m glad to report food is the whole point of it. José, a Panamanian chef with experience in faraway places such as Australia, is passionate about food and has a touch for unusual combinations. I`m still tasting that killer octopus, very good! He defines it as a New Panamanian Cuisine and takes pride on trying to bring out the soul of a culture through the authenticity and freshness of ingredients.</p>
<p>Second, is where the food comes from.  One of the things that makes this place great is the farm to table connection. José personally works with micro producers to get native ingredients that are little known (even to Panamanians) to work new recipes with his team through the week and be able to present the best he can to his 16 guests at his restaurant.</p>
<p>Third, you heard it right: only 16 seats. Chef`s table is four, the restaurant is only 16. A unique, intimate ambiance, where the chef gets to interact with every guest and share insight about the delicious 8 course meal that comes out of his kitchen. Open only 4 nights a week!</p>
<p>I`m not aware that anything like this has been done in Panama yet, and I`m glad Casco has been chosen to be on the leading edge once more. To make a reservation, please send an email to <a href="mailto:reservas@dondejose.com">reservas@dondejose.com</a>.</p>
<p>Thumbs up!</p>

<p>The Organización de Estados Ibero Americanos has just released a very interesting book with a really good collection of “before and after” photos of Casco Viejo.   It was a treat even for our trained eyes, finding new photos and corners of life in Panama back in the day.  A small peak for those who know Casco Viejo: can you recognize Plaza Bolivar (specifically Hotel Colombia)?</p>
<p>Not sure if this book will be for sale, but it should. We`ll try to find out if they`ll have it at the Canal Museum or maybe the recently restored Casa Soldado, where a new cultural space is being opened at the Paseo Esteban Huertas.</p>

This has been a dream come true for everyone involved, a dream that started when Casco Viejo developer Conservatorio S.A. donated space to the Danilo Perez Foundation almost ten years ago to open and grow his jazz school in Panama.  The idea was to help raise the bar of music education in Panama, by not only creating a place for talent to develop, but to have a full cycle, where students from everywhere in Panama, including surrounding areas like Chorrillo and Santa Ana, could not only access first class education but also have a quality space to play as professionals.</p>
<p>The club has been designed for the true music fan, it is a “listening room” that will have the capacity to record concerts live. Upstairs, an events area more in the lounge style can accommodate social gatherings.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who believed in this project and worked like crazy to get it to open. To Danilo Pérez and Patricia Zárate, and to the directors of Conservatorio S.A. for persevering in this vision of making Casco Viejo a great historic neighborhood, with content worth the beauty of this World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>To all the donors, fans and supporters of the Danilo Pérez Foundation and music in Panama: thank you as well!!  This was build with the effort of many with you in its heart. We hope you consider it an extension of your home.  Welcome and enjoy!</p>

<p>This week, several things are happening around the Panama Jazz Fest. One of them is the opening of the American Trade Restaurant. We were there for the tastings and had a great time. Loved everything, but specially the chayote soup with chile poblano and the tuna.  The ambiance is terrific, your meal will have views to La Merced church and I think eventually they`ll open at Plaza Herrera.  My favorite house cocktail: Nebula . But if you are into vintage drinks, they`ve rescued a couple of recipes from old Colón (Caribbean side of Panama).  If you would like to explore them, ask for Haleluia or Bird of Paradise.  Cheers!</p>

<p>You never know what you`ll find digging through the layers and layers of history while restoring a building in Casco Viejo. The photos below are from the former St. George school in Casco Viejo, which was thought to be a building from the 50`s. While restoring, the owners discovered beautiful calicanto arches, way under the concrete layers. And now, at the very entrance, the original sign that reads: &#8220;Chaluja Alfonso&#8221;.</p>
<p>I had no clue what this meant, until this past weekend when passing by with my father and his friends who grew up in Casco, they stopped and said: ah! Almacén Chaluja!.   Memories came back, stories started to flow, &#8221; do you remember when&#8230;?&#8221;.</p>
<p>I know, I love this town.</p>

<p>Those who know me, know that recycling and garbage is one of my passions. Through Casco Viejo`s Neighborhood Association (AVACA) we collaborate fully with all the recycling initiatives, beach cleanings and general crazy stuff we come up to deal creatively with our material. So imagine my pleasure to walk into Tantalo and see the most recent pieces by artist Michael Sager, who has been  working on &#8220;Tápalo&#8221;, a concept where he uses plastic bottle caps (in Spanish &#8220;tapa&#8221;) to make lamps and other objects.</p>
<p>If, like me, you have a strong interest in recycling, you can´t miss this show. All the lamp shades are by him, plus some of the pieces in the wall. And if you are interested in contacting the artist, let the staff at Tántalo know!</p>

<p>This year is starting with really interesting projects on pre sales. We`ll feature one by one, starting with Casa Boyd, a project at Calle 6ta with a young vibe and a spacious offer.</p>
<p>Only two apartments and one commercial space. The building is a modern, concrete building, with high ceilings and a great sense of space.  We like both apartments as they fit very well into Casconian`s lifestyles: one is a loft one bedroom <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000M5v0qAAB">(Apartment No. 2 ) </a>and the other one is a 1.5 bedrooms (<a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000M5vLoAAJ">Apartment No. 1</a>), which means you have a second space to use as an office or guest bedroom.</p>
<p>A spacious balcony overlooking Calle 6ta, one of the widest side streets in San Felipe.</p>
<p>Below, a unique property: a<a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000M66UJAAZ"> 230 mt2 commercial space</a> that is being planned as a restaurant. It will include an internal patio with a transparent roof, so you can use it all year round.  The locale can also be divided into smaller ones, in case a different concept is required.</p>

<p>When I was little, my grandmother used to do a big nativity scene at the lobby of her house for Christmas.  My brother, cousin and I participated putting it together, filling up the &#8220;town&#8221; with &#8220;residents&#8221; made of every toy we could find. So if you looked closer, you had on the same &#8220;land in time&#8221; small green soldiers, dinosaurs and probably a couple of Transformers right next to the classic donkeys, cows, sheep and baby Jesus. After finishing hers, a super treat was to go see other people`s nativity scenes. I remember this guy who used the whole garage, and it was awesome: every single detailed was perfect, he even included at some point working fountains and mills. I think he also had dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Keeping with the holiday spirits, yesterday Casco Viejo`s Neighborhood Association (AVACA) organized a small event to visit the amazing collection of around the world nativity scenes of the Lewis family. Members of AVACA could admire hundreds of big and small scenes from literally everywhere: Europe, Africa, America, Asia, Australia. It was fun to see each one`s interpretation of that single event, and how beautifully each one spoke of its own culture. There was also the &#8220;baby corner&#8221;, my favorite version made with little rubber ducks.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to the Lewis family for allowing AVACA to come in and enjoy this unique collection!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>This week I`ve been taking care of my nephew at my grandmother`s house. One of the many treats of doing it, is that I get to take a look at our old family albums with photos from when the family lived in Calle 6ta, next to the Canal Museum, back then the Mail &amp; Telegraphy headquarters.</p>
<p>My dad, when thinking back at his childhood, always referred at that balcony fondly, the time spend there with friends and family.  But only yesterday, while looking at the albums I could find a glimpse of those memories, as I found two photos of them having fun, as we say in Spanish: &#8220;balconeando&#8221;.  Here they are! in one of them you can see Plaza Catedral at the back. On the other one, today`s &#8220;Casa Mallet&#8221; at A Avenue and 6th.</p>
<p>One of my dad`s famous anecdotes was that one day, while my grandma was working at the Telegraphy she saw my dad (and probably others) riding the balcony as horses. Yep. You can imagine the rest of the story, better spelled as t.r.o.u.b.l.e&#8230;  why am I not surprised?</p>

<p>Mother`s day at the American Trade Hall in Casco Viejo was awesome: music, kids running around getting their faces painted, mimosas in every hand, excellent food and desserts.  The place looked like a war zone afterwards, kids happily asleep, exhausted after playing so much. Some, like my nephews where still going&#8230; but they are like that battery TV commercial with the pink bunny and the drum&#8230; I wished I had brought my dog Chispa, I think she is the only one that can match their energy levels!</p>

<p><a href="www.avaca.org.pa">AVACA,</a> Casco Viejo`s neighborhood association has been for the last 3 years doing projects to attack the littering and garbage management in the neighborhood.  This year, their flag <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cascorecicla">program is recycling</a>, which has proven to quickly catch up, pulling out of the streets about 10,000 pounds of recyclable material in less than 3 months.</p>
<p>Last weekend, a group of volunteers helped get the space ready for the massive Christmas celebrations. The space is all color coded now, tanks in place. A few things to finalize will be ready by next week&#8230; and then&#8230; bring us your garbage! (please make sure the material is clean&#8230; no milk inside the tetrapack!!!)  no need to see glass, plastic and specially cardboard boxes on the streets.</p>
<p>The recycling center is located at the Santa Familia building, at 4th street and A Avenue. If you are coming with a lot of material, you can use the entrance at 5th street by the parking lot.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating, contact Jennifer at director@avaca.org.pa and she`ll put you in touch with the garbage team.</p>

<p>Young Panamanian dancers debut as choreographers tonight, at<a href="http://www.prensa.com/impreso/vivir/siembra-creadores/241142"> &#8220;Young Choreographers&#8221;</a> contemporary dance performance at the Anita Villalaz Theater in Plaza Francia.  Donation; $5.</p>
<p>All this week: Flea Market at Casa Góngora, in pro of Olga Sinclair Foundation.  Furniture, clothing, accesories, paintings and more, Casa Góngora is inviting you to pass by and get your Christmas presents while helping the Foundation. They also have exposed on their upper floor an interesting collection including beautiful balconies of Casco Viejo made by Ida Vallarino. It is amazing the work that was put in each one, we were impressed by the level of detail and accuracy with some of the old photos.</p>

<p>Simply the most ambitious and beautiful restoration done to date in Casco Viejo.  A delicate blend of Panama`s tropical culture with contemporary style.  Inside and outside connect through triple height glass windows, lush tropical plants inside echo with Plaza Herrera`s big trees.  Thoughtful details everywhere, my favorite being the old style library, where books have been cherry picked by the owners evoking the golden era of travel, back when it really meant exploring. You`ll find books from pioneers telling their tales of joy, struggle and wonder. You`ll also find a pool, a gym, and a jazz bar (opening soon!).</p>
<p>I should do a post only on the American Trade History. But I`m so excited that for now I`m just going to post some of my photos&#8230;</p>

<p>I love December in Panama, and specially here in Casco where things just happen unexpectedly. I was walking around yesterday, when all of the sudden the SPI band started playing in the plaza. They marched all the way to Plaza Herrera and did a small but fabulous concert! Christmas carols with salsa and jazz rhythms. Increíble&#8230;</p>
<p>Officially starting the season, this Saturday will be the annual Carol by Candlelight event, this year to fundraise for the children of Malambo and Santo Tomás Hospital. Find out more<a href="http://www.newsroompanama.com/panama/6561-carols-by-candlelightnew-panama-tradition-moves-to-cinta-costera.html"> HERE</a>.  It has grown so much since they started a few years ago at Plaza Francia! this year it will be held at Cinta Costera by the Plaza Cincuentenario.

<p>Each Christmas I take on making my own Christmas tree. I have already done newspaper, plastic bottles, cans, glass bottles and even using beach pebbles (with the cans).  Although the first versions where medium size trees, since I moved I`m more into mini versions.  Recently I bumped into them at Pinterest, what an amazing moment, to see myself pinned and re pinned!</p>
<p>This year, I decided to go &#8220;beach style&#8221; and use found things at the beach, adding to other stuff I had at home. From plastic hearts and sandals to CocaCola polar bears, here is my Mini Eco Christmas Tree for 2013. I`m also adding a center piece with plastic stars that I found also at the beach. I`ve used them every year (as chandelier and general decoration). This time, I decided to go with a small centerpiece and see how it looked. Love it!</p>

<p>Did you know there is a florist in Casco Viejo? we visited her store in Calle 12 and A Avenue last week with a group we were touring. I enjoy Calle 12 a lot because it has several of those old trades: there is at least one shoe guy, two tailors and the florist.  The name of the shop is La Decorativa, and you can make your orders by email or cellphone. They have done several events for Hotel Ejecutivo, a corporate hotel out of Casco, including small corporate meetings and even weddings.  Contact them at: fdecorativas@hotmail.es  They speak Spanish only! but if you go there and point out what you need I`m sure they`ll figure it out.</p>

<p>I can´t remember when I saw my last rainbow, but yesterday seemed perfect for it: at 5 p.m. Casco Viejo`s skies had this beautiful golden light, but with thin clouds, producing a large rainbow. Since today is AVACA`s 7th Thanksgiving celebration, I take it as an omen of a fantastic party! Lucky Seven&#8230; Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!</p>

<p>Mother`s day always brings joy and stress at the same time. What to do? where to go? how to pick a place where everyone in the family has a space, children, babies, aunties, grandmas, moms of all ages?  Our suggestion: nowhere better than American Trade Hotel.  Not only they`ll have a great buffet by awarded chef Clara Icaza, but they`ll make the whole thing easy for you with valet parking and an &#8220;activity room&#8221; for children with &#8220;cuenta cuentos&#8221; (storytellers) that will help keep the young ones entertained.</p>
<p>Live music by Luis Carlos Pérez Quartet!</p>
<p>Can´t miss it!</p>

<p>As summer makes its way into Panama (when the rest of the universe is going into cold winter), mornings have an early start. The sun comes out half hour early and goes down half hour early, probably the only &#8220;daylight&#8221;difference you`ll find throughout the year.</p>
<p>I woke up and took my camera to Las Bovedas, as the sky was so pretty. The streetlights were still on, they looked like candles in a birthday cake, soon to be blown away. The expectation of a beautiful day builds up in everyone lucky to be looking out at the right moment.</p>

<p>Dom Cartooch is a French artist who lived in Casco for years.  At some point I saw him roaming around with a meassuring tape and students sometimes with him, and I wasn´t really sure what he was up to other than modeling some buildings.  But it wasn´t just &#8220;some buildings&#8221;&#8230; it was the entire historic site of Casco Antiguo!</p>
<p>What an amazing task!</p>
<p>This week, the 9 mt x 6 mt model is being shown at the University of Panama, Architecture Faculty. The project was done together with Peruvian Erasmo Benoutte and will be at the University until November 26.  The challenge will be bringing this to Casco (as it is so big!) and having it be a permanent exhibit somewhere.</p>
<p>Congratulations Dom and Erasmo! Check out the article with photos here:</p>

<p>One of my favorite churches in Casco Viejo, the San Felipe Neri church is open (finally!) to the public.  From 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. you`ll be able to go in and experience the beauty of its intimate ambiance.  Built in 1688 it has so far 325 years. Take a look at the altar, but specially the chorus at the back of the church. Each part of this church has a story to tell,  specially those buried inside (so be careful where you step!).  Graves dating from 1850`s and probably before, people who lived through so many changes.</p>
<p>Every time I visit this church it reminds me of how quickly and dramatically the world has changed, from charcoal to electricity, from smoke to penicillin, from imperialism to democracy. But somehow there is a sense of stillness when you stand there, in its humble quietness.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Patriot Holidays are here! For me it is still amazing that a country managed to have its independence from one country, separation from another, flag days and more compounded in one month. Yes, that is Panama! Never mind that the independence (Panama from Spain) happened in 1821 and the separation (Panama from Colombia) in 1903.</p>
<p>However, few know that the current version of Panama`s flag (blue, red, white and stars) was not the first version. There were a couple before that, and at least one part of a conspiracy.  The final (and current version) has a beautiful story though: it symbolizes the peace between Panama`s two rivaling parties (Conservative and Liberal) which would be the foundation of the new country. That is why white is between both red and blue pavilions, a nation of peace under one flag.</p>
<p>Happy holiday weekend!</p>

<p>Last night we went to a beautiful silent auction: art pieces made by children from <a href="http://www.fundacioncalicanto.org/">Fundación Calicanto</a>`s dance program called Enlaces.</p>
<p>The pieces were made by the children while dancing: canvases stretched on the floor and on the wall, while the children danced with feet and hands wet in paint.  The video was fabulous and so were the results!</p>
<p>The paintings will be exhibited at Tántalo for a couple of weeks, so if you are in Casco Viejo, please pass by. It was a very exciting event, congratulations to Enlaces and to all the teachers and companies who supported it. But specially to everyone who placed a bet and bought. Thanks for supporting the program!</p>

<p>I enjoy Santa Ana. It is a mess, but I really like it. The plaza is full of trees, and people just &#8220;hangs&#8221;.  We were there because of the PRISMA dance festival: they had scheduled a performance at the plaza`s gazebo. While waiting, I took some photos of the whole scene: kids playing with umbrellas, some old folks fully engaged in their board game. The music started and people piled up.  I wished I had a better camera, just to take photos of their faces and expressions! art at work&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo Panama Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>The first time I heard the &#8220;I`m a Type A&#8221; phrase, was from a New Yorker. I thought he was talking about blood types, and it did take some time to my friend to be able to describe it to me.  Please note: description (even a full description which included hand signals) does not ensure comprehension. I felt like all of a sudden we were both using the same language but absolutely worlds apart. Pluto and Saturn colliding, no wonder: he was from New York, I`m from Panama. My brain squeezed while my whole being was like&#8230; what?</p>
<p>After researching about<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"> &#8220;Type A&#8221;</a> in Wikipedia, there are a lot of characteristics to it, very few &#8220;tropical&#8221;, so to speak. And here is the challenge: how to be enough type A so that you move forward, but enough type whatever else, enough to know how to navigate these waters. It is not easy and this, above all, is the main sin many commit.</p>
<p>I guess the best way we`ve come up in order to describe  it is like this: basically you are running inside a pool full of water. This is the surest way to burn out and not get anywhere. You need to swim. How? that`s the trick, the art. You have to slow down your revolutions in order to catch the rhythm, understand the why`s and the style. Once you do, then you can input. But if you do it in reverse, your &#8220;type A glasses&#8221; won´t allow you to see reality and people who you will depend to in order to get things done will perceive you as arrogant and difficult.</p>
<p>An example I like about this, which embodies everything I`ve been posting about in the last week is this (true story!): a friend who took on the titanic job of finishing a building that was not his project to begin with, came in and took the following approach with a problem. The wood floors were not being installed right. He himself knew how to do it (<a href="http://arcoproperties.com/2013/10/sin-no-3-inexperience-rocks-falling-from-the-sky/">experience</a>), and his type A personality knew he couldn´t let this just &#8220;go&#8221;. He didn´t speak enough Spanish to communicate, but he was very committed to this project (<a href="http://arcoproperties.com/2013/10/deadly-sin-no-1-acedia/">acedia</a> vs <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/2013/10/sin-no-2-a-cold-heart/">bonding</a>). So, he decided to show up one morning, earlier than anyone, and started installing it himself. The wood guy came in and saw him.  Very surprised, he started watching and my friend looked at him with a smile and said: do you like how this looks? The guy actually did like it, but what was more important, was actually key is that  he liked that the &#8220;owner&#8221; of the project demonstrated to be a humble person (vs what he had experienced before), willing to get dirty with the work himself, and with a smile. And, although the technique was new to him (which always, always, always, causes tons of friction) the approach was the right one for the occasion and the level.  The guy learned it side by side with the owner of the project, learned there are human beings on both sides of the paycheck, that someone really cared, and actually&#8230; that the technique happened to be faster and better.</p>
<p>In return, you will learn that a number of things you know work around the world, are difficult to implement here (weather, materials or needs special training), although not all.  Or you will learn that listening to the building vs imposing is the best you can do (see: <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/2013/10/sin-no-2-a-cold-heart/">a cold heart</a>). Sometimes, when &#8220;hitting the ground running&#8221; you don´t see it, leading you to expensive mistakes.</p>
<p>All of this requires tuning in, eyes and ears wide open, but also a humble heart. The good news is, after all this effort, buildings built on a humble heart come out and show beautifully.</p>
<p>There is nothing that brings us more pleasure than seeing someone be successful at restoring a building. The advice in this series have been compiled through the experiences of a number of buildings and owners earning their badges (or not!), and while they make seem like common sense, do not dismiss them when approaching your own project. As they say, you can learn from someone telling you how to swing a cat by the tail, but only when you try swinging one yourself is when the advice you heard makes sense!</p>
<p>So&#8230; Happy swinging!  Miau!</p>

<p>In order to develop buildings in Casco Antiguo you have to have previous experience in some sort of field related to building.  This is an activity that should be labeled: &#8220;Not For The Faint Of Heart&#8221;. Either you know what your doing and therefore you have a realistic approach to your dream, or you are a very curious mind, a hands on personality packed with passion and willing to roll up your sleeves and dig in head first researching and sweating it with a smile.  I`ve seen both cases, and they both work out well.</p>
<p>What doesn´t work is someone who treats the project &#8220;as a hobby&#8221;, with the &#8220;no, I`ll just hire someone down here to do it&#8221; mind frame. Normally this doesn´t go anywhere: an owner without a true grasp on reality is bound to fail, and delegating his responsibility to someone in the field that has no skin in the game is the wrong approach for this type of activity.</p>
<p>It reminds me a lot of that old insurance commercial where everyone was happy while nothing happened, and when suddenly a big rock came from the sky and smashed the car, everyone flew away and the poor owner of the car was left with the mess and no backup (blaming the rock, probably).  There are no warranties and stuff will always come up to the point you do think rocks are literally coming down from the sky, but experience and/or being 100% involved is the best way to prevent situations or at least to keep it to a minimum.</p>
<p>Sounds like common sense? you would be surprise of the number of &#8220;sinners&#8221; out there&#8230;</p>

<p>I`m sure some poet must have said it at some point, somewhere: inexperience can be excused, but never lack of passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not develop your historic building using only excel&#8221;.</p>
<p>While excel is necessary to understand profitability, this 300 year old site holds buildings that are loaded with a character of their own. They want to tell you their stories, they want you to bring them back. They were made with noble materials and at a human scale that related to people back then and now. They don´t know nor care about excel. They just are and have survived generations. Developing them is a long process that involves a lot of micro managing and balls in the air, which are incredibly interesting and beautiful for those who have passion. If not, then nothing makes sense, leading to early burn out and quitting. Don´t get me wrong, having experience helps bigtime, and excel is important. But having passion is a Casco Viejo must-have.</p>
<p>My favorite story about bonding was from a developer that did pretty much everything himself.  Every day I passed by I saw him doing something different, supervising others, but also straight up doing the work and sweating it. And smiling. I can assure you there is no detail in his building he doesn´t know first hand, a wonderful case of the jockey getting to know his horse and the horse his master. When a project gets to be that intimate, it shows. And when it is done only with excel, with no love in the process&#8230; well, it has very visible consequences.</p>
<p>One love! Let`s get together and build alright!</p>

<p>When compiling common denominators on why some developments have failed, I came across this word: Acedia, which is mentioned in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins">Wikipedia`s</a> Seven Deadly Sins article, under &#8220;historical sins&#8221;. With such a name and classification, I had to start with that one! Although I must say there is another one that I consider the biggest one of them all. I`ll save that one for last, as it embodies so much. But let`s start with &#8220;Acedia&#8221;.</p>
<p>Several definitions on it, but the &#8220;historical sin&#8221; refers to the &#8220;neglect to do something that one should do&#8221;.</p>
<p>And the first thing you should know you should do is be in Panama during the construction. &#8220;You Shall Not Run The Project By Control Remote&#8221;. &#8220;Thy Building is Not Thy TV&#8221;.</p>
<p>If when thinking of developing in Casco this is not within your plans, forget it. Even if you have a pool full of cash back at home that you don´t know what to do with and are willing to flush it down to your building in Casco Viejo. It doesn´t matter.  There is just no substitute for your presence. You might have a five star project manager and architect team, but you are the one writing the checks and the you are the ultimate responsible for soooo many things. Don´t think that insurance clause in the contract you signed with the builder will protect you.  Panama is all about what you can prevent, and there is no better prevention than your own eye in the battlefield, so to speak.   Old shopkeepers knew this when they used to say the success of a store was that the owner had to be there. In Spanish, &#8220;el ojo del amo engorda al ganado&#8221;.</p>
<p>For historic sins&#8230;do apply historic wisdom!</p>

<p>Now, after my &#8220;silly Casco&#8221; we get all serious!</p>
<p>I got a suggestion which I thought was really interesting and probably super helpful for people thinking in restoring in Casco Viejo. What have been the main &#8220;sins&#8221; of unsuccessful developments. We`ve seen plenty! but once you group them together, it all comes down to a few, strong (and hopefully avoidable) ones.</p>
<p>So, keep tuned to next week! we`ll be unveiling the &#8220;development sins&#8221; in Casco Viejo, but something tells me those will be applicable to other parts of the country as well.</p>
<p>Have a beautiful weekend!</p>

<p>I always find the strangest things when walking around Casco Viejo. Thought it would make for a fun Monday! I mean, not everything has to be hard core real estate, right? I feel this is the type of photo you can use like the New Yorker cartoon at the back of the magazine, where you have to send your quote and the best three get published on the next edition. Want to give it a try?</p>

<p>Casa Gongora is probably the only &#8220;100% Spanish Colonial&#8221; building (residential) in Casco Viejo. Located at the corner of 4th and Central, the house currently belongs to the government, but we are glad to announce that finally it has been given to the <a href="http://fundacionolgasinclair.org/">Olga Sinclair Foundation </a>to run it.</p>
<p>Downstairs, a lovely café offers lunch (delicious paella on Thursdays!) surrounded by art pieces from different local artists. Upstairs, a space for events and itinerary art shows. Right now, until October 14th, there is an interesting show of Panama`s Young Architects (JAP, in Spanish Jóvenes Arquitectos de Panamá).</p>
<p>We love having new spaces for art open in Casco!</p>

<p>Finally I had a Sunday where my biggest preoccupation was to attend my garden.  I`m the laziest gardener ever, and even on weekends I get stuck on so many things! but yesterday I was delighted to choose between singing to my plants and walking my dog.  Panama is such an easy place to do urban gardening, that even I can have a cool collection of herbs and plants. Here are my photos!</p>

<p>Everyone who knows me knows I have a soft spot for ballet, specially good ballet and good ballet danced by friends. Last night, Coppelia checked all the boxes: choreography and direction by Russian and Czech`s masters Vasily Medvedev and Stanislav Feco, dance by my former troupe Panama`s National Ballet, female leading rol by friend and beautiful dancer Alexa Gutiérrez and male leading rol by former student of our ballet school, Solieh Samudio. I had a blast!</p>
<p>The production was well put together, a great one to take everyone in the family! so don´t miss the next nights, they are on until September 22nd. Tickets can be bought at Ticket Plus online, once you purchase, print the confirmation sheet and they`ll be waiting for you at the theater. Because the casts change every night, if you want to see Alexa again, she will be dancing on Thursday. Congratulations to everyone in the production!</p>

<p>On Sunday, Casco Antiguo`s Neighborhood Association and Sembrarte, a foundation that works to promote art in Panama joined hands to &#8220;recycle with art&#8221;.   Several businesses and residents participated donating recycling material, which was used in the workshop to make toys and pieces guided by artists from Sembrarte, including Rolo de Sedas and Frank Ferrer. Other AVACA members present on Sunday helping with the workshop were Blanca Dávalos, Mitchelle Quiñones, Ivana Rabbat and Jennifer Hotsko.  Irving De La Rosa and Faustino Romero were in charge of picking up material during the week and sorting it out.</p>
<p>The most important part of this effort is that AVACA`s team is considering promoting recycling as part of their &#8220;garbage committee&#8221; programs. We are excited about what will be their next step!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>The first time I heard the name was buying tea at Casa Sucre. Alyce had this &#8220;Moringa&#8221; tea that tasted great and apparently was not only good but super good for you. The name sounded so funny and the photo of the leaves seemed familiar, just I couldn´t place it in my mind. But then my husband pointed out to me: remember that tree Spencer planted in Calle 4ta that he said it is being proposed as the solution to malnutrition in Africa? I couldn´t believe it, the famous &#8220;Tree of Life&#8221; was right in front of me!Researching in youtube, I see that it can be propagated by sticking a branch on the ground. The leaves have kind of a nutty taste, but just like watercress you might find it quite spicy if you eat the stems, so watch out. Don´t over do it!</p>
<p>In Wikipedia, I find that this plant has a ton of everything, quoting here:</p>
<p>&#8220;The leaves are rich in protein, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C and minerals. 100g of fresh Moringa leaves have 8.3 g protein, 434 mg calcium, 404 mg potassium, 738 μg vitamin A, and 164 mg vitamin C Feeding the high protein leaves to cattle has been shown to increase weight gain by up to 32% and milk production by 43 to 65%. The seeds contain 30 to 40% oil that is high in oleic acid, while degreased meal is 61% protein. The defatted meal is a flocculant and can be used in water purification to settle out sediments and undesirable organisms&#8221;</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.treesforlife.org/our-work/our-initiatives/moringa">Tree of Life.org</a> I learn that it has: 7 times the vitamin C of oranges, 4 times the vitamin A of carrots, 4 times the calcium in milk, 3 times the potassium in bananas and 2 times the protein in yogurt.</p>
<p>So now I`m using it on tea, salads, stir fries and smoothies.  Try it out! if you want to plant a branch let us know and we`ll give you a stick.</p>

<p>I was after Miguel Lombardo for months&#8230; when? when?.. finally! here it is&#8230;.</p>
<p>Right next to the French Embassy, there is a little, cute place that has just opened called Dodó. It is almost like the café equivalent of a secret garden, you have to dock in order to get in, but once you are there it is charming as it can be.</p>
<p>Run by Marcela Lombardo, Miguel`s mom, she defines it as a place for light food: salads, sandwiches and desserts. But I already got feedback from some of Dodo`s first clients and they tell me they have excellent coffee and that vegetarian options (and vegan!) are on the way.</p>
<p>Another nice thing to know about Dodò is that they are open for breakfast: 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Closed on Mondays, open the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Thumbs up!</p>

<p>And right on time to celebrate the 500 years of the first catholic church in the New World.  It was a whole thing to put them up there: street closed, big cranes, take a look! Absolutely a historic moment at La Merced church. Consider that the first bells lasted basically 800 years (they were already old when they came! I figure they didn´t want to &#8220;pack&#8221; new bells for such a dangerous journey!).  Wonder if the new ones will last that much.  Let`s keep count, and if they don´t by year 500, let`s ask our money back!</p>

<p>Casco Viejo has a wealth of colonial monuments, many of them are churches. It is a challenge for every historic city to keep them in good shape, but in the tropics this effort basically doubles because of the humid climate and materials that were originally used.  Proper knowledge of how to properly treat them is always in demand, but even more, funding.</p>
<p>This year, we were glad to learn about a group of passionate Casco Viejo fans who have gathered together and formed a group to take on the task. As a private group, they would be able to carry on a master plan to restore 5 of the six main churches in Casco Viejo, in a professional and continuous way.  Last night we attended a talk by Ricardo Gago, its main spokesman who showed us the several degrees of damage (depending on the churches) and how they`ve started their work.</p>
<p>Today, a historic moment is taking place: the bells of La Merced Church are being changed. The original bells, from the 1200`s were taken down (this on its own was a whole day task with several experts involved). This morning, new bells are being lifted and installed. They were made by a Spanish company, one of those family run businesses who all they`ve done for generations is to craft these amazing pieces of art.</p>
<p>They are hoping to tune the bells this upcoming week and finally be able to play them in an exciting first time (in at least 50 years) in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>If you are interested in helping, donating, being part of, we would like to invite you to contact Ricardo through their Facebook page.  The page is mainly in Spanish, but they are bilingual, so do write them!. Congratulations to Mario and Ricardo for this very much needed initiative!  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PTYCAICA">Click HERE. </a></p>

<p>I came across a magazine called Cuasimodo, which was edited back in the early Republic days. This ad was found in a 1919 magazine, I have to say it is one of my favorites. Stores back then sold everything&#8230; at the same place and under the same counter. Items like &#8220;soap&#8221; were written in BIG BOLD LETTERS, as they were luxury items. Medicines were labeled (hum&#8230; were they labeled?) basically &#8220;drugs&#8221;, and claims of them curing anything would be based on the reputation of whomever sold that jar with pungent dark liquid in it to you.</p>
<p>&#8220;El Cielo&#8221;, or &#8220;The Heaven&#8221; listed the items that made it famous or popular. Included, and I`m sure not limited to: rifles, guns, buttons, lace, ladies stalkings, sewing machines, lace, handkerchiefs and shoe soles. Please note that in big bold letters it says: <strong>MATA BICHOS</strong> (bug killer) and <strong>SOAP</strong>. Hey, we might have been a rough town, but at least we smelled good!</p>

<p>If you have never been to a CAPTA graduation event by Fundación Calicanto, you are missing an experience.  But no worries, you`ll be able to correct that pretty soon! Next Wednesday, August 28th at the Canal Museum. Twenty women from Casco Viejo, Santa Ana and Chorrillo will graduate from a program that has given them the personal and professional tools to take control of their lives and break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>The program`s results are outstanding. After graduation, more than 70% are able to get permanent employment&#8230; and able to keep it a year later. It is a direct impact on the whole family, one woman at a time. If you are in Casco, you can´t miss it!</p>

<p>Yesterday I passed by Santa Familia and heard laughter coming out of El Cuarto Rojo. Children from APROJUSAN, an ngo that works with kids from the neighborhood were taking aerial dance classes with El Cuarto Rojo. Some of the boys were juggling, the girls were totally into climbing and swinging.  We love seeing kids getting new experiences, APROJUSAN has done a great job of exposing them to arts, music and now dance. I had to take a photo&#8230; they were so serious hanging up there trying to figure it out!</p>

<p>Yesterday a group of &#8220;vecinos&#8221; gathered to celebrate the soft opening of IPANEMA.  Located on First street and A Avenue by Henrique De Oliveira who is from Brazil, but worked in Madagascar for many years.   The food was great, loved the dorado with coconut sauce. Green and tropics everywhere! Officially open on the 15th of March!  I hope they soon offer feijoada&#8230; yummy!..   Welcome!</p>

<p>Panamanian summer really hit town on February. Everyone went to the the beach during carnivals, but now back in the city, all public spaces are full with people jogging, walking, cycling. This morning, a spectacular sun lifting from the ocean. One of the things I enjoy living in Casco is the easy access to outdoor public spaces, including beach and parks!</p>
<p>And for those who enjoy yoga and health workshops, see below upcoming events for the rest of February and March.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panamá, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Traffic today is a main concern for everyone. Even though the Metro has improved the situation a lot, and the bus lines are far better now, it continues to be a critical factor for those who commute hours to and from home. Add normal errands like food and medicine, or just stuff that makes your life better like going out with friends, going to the theater or movies, you realize your quality of life has to come hand in hand with living the closest possible to the city center.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons we love the revitalization that is happening at the historic side of Santa Ana, specially by Grupo Conservatorio with their developments: Casa Patterson, La Manzana and Casa Balcones. Aimed to those looking to buy their first home, it offers units starting at $80,000, with one and two bedrooms, bathroom and balcony.  Steps away from everything: supermarket, stores, pool, plazas and all the cultural movement that Casco is known for. And yes, Santa Ana is part of Casco! and therefore elegible for Casco´s incentive´s law 136.</p>
<p>Casa Patterson is under construction and delivering at the ends of this year. Casa Balcones and La Manzana are already on pre sales. If you are interested in living in the city center, let us know! We are also learning from our clients experiences, and taking statistics on how living close to the center saves them time, money and improves their lives.  If you have a story you would like to share, please send it to patrizia@arcoproperties.com</p>

<p>If you´ve been to our office, you know our most popular sales agent is our dog Chispa (Sparkles). And even though every day is Chispa Day and every year is Chispa Year, we are super excited that 2018 is Year of the Dog for Chinese calendar!</p>
<p>Celebrations are big here, the chinese community has been celebrating since yesterday (the original Chinese neighborhood is in Casco, and then there is a second one by El Dorado at the city). If you want to catch their best show, go to ATLAPA tonight. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FESTIVALANONUEVOCHINO/photos/a.264608926980156.58237.163686590405724/1838056702968696/?type=1&amp;theater">Information here! </a></p>

<p>Today, and only until Sunday, a public transient art installation by Cuadra Panama: temporary architecture at the Boyaca plaza and Compañía de Jesus monument (both at A Avenue, one by Plaza Herrera and the other one in front of Saquella).  These installations were built by students of Escuela Taller from the Office of Casco Antiguo, and they seek to create a dialogue between modern architecture and historic patrimony.</p>

<p>The long time &#8220;under construction&#8221; corner of Calle 5ta and A Avenue is awakening, little by little.  A restaurant on one side, and a shop on the next one. Today we`ll post about the shop: Galeria Latina.</p>
<p>Run by Obdulio Isarama, it features some of the best Wounaan and Embera baskets I`ve seen so far. The shop also features Latinamerican crafts, right now they have high end alpaca coats from Peru, silver crafts from Ecuador and the always lovable and irreverent Mexican scenes with tons of laughing skeletons in them.</p>
<p>If you want to contact them, here is their info: panamanativeart@gmail.com  alinaitucama@hotmail.com.  Phones: 314-1985 And their website (under construction still) www.panamanativearts.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>It is football season in Panama, everyone seems to be aware of when, where and against whom the Panamanian team is playing.  Since I cheer for everyone (a bad habit that can get me into trouble if I`m on the wrong side of the fence), I have left it to chance and destiny to learn when there is a game. Luckily, in Casco Viejo it is impossible not to know, for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Everyone wears red (the team color) all day long, all week long</p>
<p>2. Conversations tend to be football oriented, no matter what you are talking about (which makes it really interesting!, and I`ve tried different themes)</p>
<p>3. You can watch the whole thing just walking around the streets of Casco.</p>
<p>The results are known depending on the emotional state of the whole neighborhood: complete silence after midnight? we lost.  Party time? we won. Fireworks? we won, &#8220;on-your-face-bigtime!&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night there were fireworks and general happiness!!! big congratulations to the Panamanian team because it was a tough one against Mexico`s big boys.  Sunday is the next one! tune to the streets of Casco!</p>

<p>Busy? don´t have time to cook, but are health conscious? there is a delicious new option for you in Casco Viejo: private chefs! young, creative professionals that are reaching out and catering to private individuals. We`ll be featuring a couple, as this new type of business grows in the community. Prices are competitive and food is really nice.</p>
<p>I believe I`ve posted before on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sophia.boesenberg?fref=ts">Sophie Boesenberg</a>, who also participates in the Pot to Plate ngo. Today`s blog is for Catriona White, a young chef that lives in Calle 6ta. What I like about her menus is that she has a bit for everyone: vegetarians and non vegetarians.  The way it works is that she sends her week menu to her mailing list. You need to &#8220;rsvp&#8221; by email, tell her where to drop the meals and when. Voilà!</p>
<p>Here is her contact info:</p>
<p>catrionacwhite@gmail.com</p>
<p><i>Private Chef<br />
MiniHaha Gourmet<br />
61177450</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/catriona.white.39?fref=ts">FACEBOOK PAGE HERE</a></p>
<p>and here is a sample of what her options look like:</p>

<p>I was impressed, which is to say a lot because being a ballet teacher and ex professional dancer I don´t tend to get impressed when it comes to physical instruction.  My back was hurting after a 10 day trip (courtesy of airplane chairs) so I decided to take a yoga class that was at El Cuarto Rojo`s schedule on their door. Monday, 6 p.m., $15, sounds good to me! Let`s see what they`ve got&#8230;.</p>
<p>And it was really cool. I`m sitting here at my desk and my happy back is dictating my fingers what to write! Strengthened and stretched, beautiful!</p>
<p>Teacher &#8220;Ari&#8221; (<a href="http://www.arikuki.com/biografia/">Ariadna Sanmai Robles</a>) is a petite, sweet and powerful lady. She`s got a nice sense of humor as well! The class is for every level, so no worries.  Also loved her blog, so if you are interested, <a href="http://www.arikuki.com/category/yoga/">check it out here.   </a></p>
<p>After making us sweat, stretch, grab, twist &amp; hold, Ari gave our senses a gift by massaging our heads with a lemongrass oil that got my soul smiling.</p>
<p>But if you are into physical activity, you should definitely contact El Cuarto Rojo. They have several classes, including aerial dancing. Contacts in the images below!</p>

<p>Several friends have told me that there was this &#8220;amazing&#8221; fish tacos place in Clayton that we just had to try.  I did, yesterday, and from Casco Viejo!</p>
<p>Located right in front of the Lottery building, at Central Avenue and 10th, this place not only is super cute but it has really good food.  We ordered the green curry fish and the red curry one. Not only we licked the plate, but I almost ordered a second one, and the plate from the table next to me.</p>
<p>Right now they are open only for lunch, but Maurice and Michael (the owners) are considering extending until sunset.  Welcome guys!</p>

<p>For the longest time our friend Hamzah was our version of a knight in shining armor. And I`m serious about it, white horse and everything! He would come to the rescue of my computer and phone system delivering great service. Now, he has opened a business in Casco Viejo!</p>
<p>Still IT related, &#8220;OSHITEC&#8221; will repair computers, but also will provide other services like internet café, photocopies (you always need one!), international phone calls (always handy for visitors) and sales of CD, USB, and even alarm services.</p>
<p>Where? They are at A Avenue, between 4th and 5th, right in front of the Art Deco building.  Here is their info! Welcome OSHITEC!</p>

<p>With two oceans at its disposal,Panama is blessed with the ability to get great fish. Entrepreneurs have taken notice, as three new restaurants opened in Casco, two of them focused on fish and seafood. This week I`ll be writing about them all, today starting with Finca del Mar (The Sea`s Farm).</p>
<p>It is located at Calle 2da, by the French Embassy and it is owned and run by a French team.  After spending some days in the Basque coast of France, I`m really looking forward to try their food. The place looks really nice, the open terrace and gardens have a chill ambiance.</p>
<p>They will be opened from 8 a.m. until late at night, so they will be offering breakfast!  Here is their celphone for more info and reservations 6744-6223</p>

<p>Someone approached me the other day about the Metro Bus, if it reached Casco and how to use it. I was confused myself on how to go about it, since they have changed routes and where to get the card, so what I did was to ride it last Sunday and here are my notes on it:</p>
<figure id="attachment_8200" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/inside-bus.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8200" alt="Inside the bus" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/inside-bus-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/inside-bus-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/inside-bus.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside the bus</figcaption></figure>
<p>CARD: I found myself asking everywhere for one, and no one sold it.  The nearest posts I could verify are: at Plaza 5 de Mayo (the sidewalk next to the old train station) and the stop they call &#8220;Mercado de Mariscos&#8221; which is actually not at the Fish Market (close, though!) but next to Cochez and the San Felipe Neri Market (you will see a big stop there with an orange fence. The card costs about $2.50 or so, and remember to ask the sales person to charge it with an amount. Each ride is about $0.25, my recommendation is that you plug in $5 and keep the card just in case.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mibus.com.pa/rutas/">ROUTES</a>: Tricky.  The two closest ones to Casco Viejo are:</p>
<p>Route Ancon &#8211; Avenida B:  You can take it at the Santa Ana plaza. This one makes a small loop through Ancon, Santa Ana, Fish Market and back. I didn´t ride the full extent of this, and couldn´t find the map in their website. But I did call the MiBus company and they confirmed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_8198" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Santa-Ana-stop.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8198" alt="Santa Ana Stop" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Santa-Ana-stop-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Santa-Ana-stop-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Santa-Ana-stop.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Santa Ana Stop</figcaption></figure>
<p>Route Cinta Costera: The closest &#8220;stop&#8221; where to take it is at the Cinta Costera, just passing the Fish Market, by the exercise area where they have all the machines.  There are several routes passing through here, most of them go all the way to Paitilla (in case you want to go to Multicentro, Bal Harbour, or the pharmacies and stores there).</p>
<figure id="attachment_8201" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_3702.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8201" alt="Stop Cinta is next to this.

<figure id="attachment_8199" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_3701.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8199" alt="Stop at Cinta Costera" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_3701-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_3701-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_3701-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Stop at Cinta Costera</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you take, let`s say, the Cinta Costera out of Casco and want to come back, then most likely you will have to take 2 buses: one to take you to the &#8220;Fish Market&#8221; stop and one to take you to Santa Ana (a.i. the Ancon- Avenida B route).  Make sure to mark the card &#8220;trasbordo&#8221; as you are leaving the bus, so that it has a better fee on the next one. If you do have a question, I found the best way is just to ask the drivers. So far, they`ve been very amiable. Not sure they speak English, but they will try to help!</p>
<p>Now, BIG tip, as it is not very obvious: the stop to get the Ancon- Avenida B is actually a few steps away from the Fish Market big stop. It is a small stop (see the small orange sign in photo) next to Republic Parking and the Pantera Rosa. Buses going through this stop are: Ancon- Avenida B and the Chorrillo route. If by mistake you take the Chorrillo route, it is not the end of the world. However, it would take you to Calle 17, which is 3 blocks away from Santa Ana and you need to know where to get down which isn´t easy to recognize. Make sure to approach the driver so he lets you know when to go down. Better keep to Ancon- Avenida B.  And if you feel like walking, you`ll probably get there faster, as this stop is basically at the commercial part of Avenida Central (Central Avenue) and walking is a treat.</p>
<figure id="attachment_8206" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/La-Chichi-stop.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8206" alt="If you call MiBus and ask, this is how they call the Ancon- Avenida B stop. &quot;La Chichi&quot; because of this building.

<p>I went all hyper yesterday at &#8220;Digna y Benito&#8221;, calle 4ta`s new store in front of Papyro y Yo. The reason? well, it just has beautiful stuff! I used the classic excuse of needing to buy something special for a friend&#8230; to buy stuff for me&#8230; jejejeje&#8230;.</p>
<p>The unusual name ties up because of the store`s concept: both &#8220;Digno&#8221; and &#8220;Benita&#8221; are common names in Panama`s countryside, specially from the Azuero arch where most of the traditional clothing such as polleras are made. The owners of the store have been working with women from this area, helping them re tool what they know (they do exquisite work, but focused on polleras and traditional clothing) to generate new designs and products.  This small &#8220;laboratory&#8221; has now lampshades, beautiful shirts and skirts, women`s shoes and even honey from the local farms!</p>
<p>If you are looking for gifts, special souvenirs, or would love to have something made for you, contact them at: info@dignoybenita.com Phone: 391-1199.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about Casco is that its community is always opening spaces to meet, mingle and share. That was the occasion when a couple of weeks ago, Esquina Photo along with Ahden Busch organized a get together for “Casco`s business women”.  Although I knew many of the girls attending, I did meet new people and loved how different country flags keep adding to Casco Viejo`s neighborhood.  From Panama, Spain, USA, Italy, Jamaica (and I`m probably forgetting a few more), we shared common interests, wine and cheese. Congratulations to Ingrid Moore and Ahden Busch for organizing it! Thank you!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Yesterday, while doing my home shores, I heard a distinctive flute playing from down the street.  I recognized it from my childhood, and I ran down to meet the guy, probably the last one in Panama in his trade. I bet I was the only one in the neighborhood who even knew what the meaning of the flute was.</p>
<p>Mr. Enzo is an Argentinian who has been in Panama for more than 30 years. His trade is a dying one in this era of easy “buy and throw away”. He sharpens. Knives, scissors, machetes, electric knives and even small ones like the tools used for manicure.  His prices range from $1 for a pair of scissors to $3 for a lawn mower. He rides on his bicycle and his only advertising while he roams the street is his flute, which he plays in a very particular way, almost like a Quetzal song.</p>
<p>He will come to your home if you call him: 6023-9378.  For less than $10 I sharpened every knife I had and threw in a machete from a neighbor who does gardening.  His flyer calls himself the “Scissors Doctor”.  It reminded me of a time where people were more frugal, repairing what they had instead of throwing it away.  My knives are now back in shape, cutting as if they were just out of the box.  Fully recommended!</p>

<p>I`m getting better at my little videos! Here are a couple of new tours:</p>
<p>Hotel Colombia: This is a two bedroom apartment, plaza front. Hotel Colombia is well known for it`s beautiful roof terrace and pool. This apartment is partially furnished and has parking!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gmver6FxsGI" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Casa Arias: this is groundfloor commercial available for retail. No restaurants nor bars! great for any other use. We would love to see something artistic in this space, as the house has such character. The patio at the back is not part of the space, although it can be used from time to time for special things, provided that it doesn´t disturb the tenants in the building.</p>

<p>I was researching the other day different festivals that have established themselves as annual attractions in Casco Viejo.  I knew there were several, but boy we have a full calendar! from the Panama Jazz Festival in January, to the FAE Theater Festival and even the International Film Festival, I think my next posting will be all the cool annual stuff that takes place in Casco so you can plan ahead.</p>
<p>But today I learned about MusicArte, an event that gather musicians from the States and Panama, and not only they do concerts together, but also interesting workshops, mainly focused on composition.  Classic and Contemporary music. Two of their performances will be at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teatroamadorpanama">Teatro Amador</a> (June 13th and 14th), starting at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prensa.com/impreso/vivir/musicarte-arte-composicion/183821">Here</a> is the note from La Prensa on it.</p>

<p>The other day I was talking to a friend and he told me how amazed he was at the number of activities his kids were, and all of them between a few blocks from each other. Knowing how parents struggle to get their children to the numerous classes they always inscribe them, I thought this was worth mentioning. So, here it is!</p>
<p>Music classes: general music appreciation classes at the <a href="http://fundaciondaniloperez.org/">Danilo Perez Foundation. </a>Here they would learn the different instruments, and tune their ears to great music.  Location: Plaza Herrera</p>
<p>Painting classes: the <a href="http://www.fundacionolgasinclair.org/">Olga Sinclair foundation</a> has an amazing way to get your kids inspired. Look for the ultra purple building next to the Danilo Perez Foundation!</p>
<p>Martial Arts (boys and girls!): kids will love their &#8220;ninja class&#8221; at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tlg.cascoviejo">Top Level Gym in Calle 4ta. </a>They have crossfit as well for parents and the mini crossfit for children.</p>
<p>Photography classes: run by photographer Tarina Rodriguez and organized through <a href="http://www.esquinaphoto.net/contact.html">Esquina Photo </a>(Ingrid Moore), I consider photography a fabulous gateway to all art appreciation because of its instant gratification! Tarina is great with kids as well!</p>
<p>And depending on the time of the year, Los Del Patio art center has yoga for kids and a bunch of other stuff. And the best (for the parent) is that commuting time is basically zero: walking from one street to the next, sometimes door to door. Priceless!</p>

<p>My belly was hurting from so much laughter! Outside my office I heard this really loud noise, children screaming laughing and things falling down, stumbling. I went out and the APROJUSAN kids where playing &#8220;congelada&#8221; (frozen) and it was to die for.  I really can´t remember the last time I played it, but I do remember having tons of fun with it.</p>
<p>Basically, someone is &#8220;it&#8221; and if he/she touches you, then you are frozen. You can be &#8220;defrosted&#8221; by a friend that runs and touches you, and there are &#8220;havens&#8221; (determined in advance) where &#8220;it&#8221; can´t reach you. The game allows for &#8220;chains&#8221; which are made by children holding hands, one touching the &#8220;haven&#8221; and the idea is to reach a &#8220;frozen&#8221; one to &#8220;defrost&#8221; him in a safe way. I loved it because it quickly makes kids run like crazy, work in a team, focus on a goal and make the best to &#8220;save&#8221; their friend.  What could be better!!! In the meantime, it is all chaos&#8230; fantastic. At the end, kids where exhausted, sweating, smiling, rushed with endorphins.  As healthy kids should be.</p>

<p>Welcome <a href="http://casanuratti.com/">Casa Nuratti!</a> right next to Tantalo, this is a spot for the young soul. The design concept brings hip and recycling together in a fresh, young look and feel.  Art hidden in every corner: from photos and crafts from local artists to a a tribute to Blek Le Rat, the graffiti French artist who back in the 50`s invented the &#8220;stencil graffiti&#8221; concept.  You`ll enjoy Nuratti, but specially the roof terrace bar which has a small pool to freshen up. Will it be open to more than guests? I still have to ask!</p>
<p>My favorite part was the thought put up on every room door. Each one is identified with a phrase that opens a question or a riddle that hints you into different parts of Panamanian culture and geography.</p>
<p>Congratulations guys!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kind of dig the mystery and awe of bumping into good/ interesting art in the street. When I travel, I always look for those big or small corners of human expression, that space someone stole from a plaza or a wall and transformed it so that people passing by had a reaction, a thought, provoked a smiled or a protest. To throw at you a silent question, make you raise or low an eyebrow.  The Bienal in Casco Viejo has been so far a little bit like this. Today I`ll issue my small and humble review from someone who knows absolutely nothing about art.  So far, this is my favorite piece. It is at the Arco Chato, and it made me think about the connectivity we have as humans between each other, and the big floating pieces of adobe suddenly became a presence on its own, one very appropriate in a 300 year old colonial town that was built initially on those very materials. I think there was a story in the Popol Vuh that said that the gods have tried humans out of dirt first and that didn´t work out too well, so later they tried carving us on wood.  Since any of those creatures had much of a feeling, then they tried corn, which was sacred and therefore the legend comes out that we are the result from that final experiment. Seeing the iron/wood/adobe installation somehow reminded me of the materials we are all made of, which I hope was the point of the whole thing. Maybe I`m wrong!   Now, Popol Vuh aside, who is the artist? Silence. There is no sign, no explanation, recognition, big or small or even digital anywhere. Not even at the Biennale website. There is nothing easy to find about the great majority of the guest artists.</p>
<p>Was this mystery in itself part of the artistic happening? I doubt it. But I`m happy I bounced into this piece, I hope you like the photos I took.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Yesterday was the graduation No. 24 of the CAPTA program of <a href="http://www.fundacioncalicanto.org/">Fundación Calicanto</a>. They now have officially graduated over 500 women, with over 73% rate of success on not only getting a job but keeping it a year after.</p>
<p>This graduation was very special, because it was one of the very few where I`ve heard some of them state being an entrepreneur as part of their dream (usually they are very focused on getting a job). This on itself is awesome.  For these women who normally come from very difficult/violent backgrounds and in really poor areas, to have that spark it is really something to admire. Between the many gifts they received during their graduation, there was a scholarship for one of the students so she can now finish Elementary School and High School. Yes, you read correctly.</p>
<p>I know that everyone knows how education is a wonderful thing, how empowerment is something good, and etc. etc. etc. But believe me, until you`ve been there, seen it, been part of this program…. You just don´t know how powerful this is.  CAPTA is not just “change” for these women. It is a change for everyone that come across it, and even if for a simple moment, can see the results in real life as opposed to an excel sheet.</p>
<p>Congratulations to every girl in this class, to the teachers, donors and organizers who make this happen against all odds every year. You guys rock!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo, Panama</p>
<p>For the last few months, members of the Casco Viejo Neighborhood Associatin (AVACA) have been meeting about a growing problem: traffic in the Casco. A handful of business owners, many of them residents, brainstormed and came up with really nice ideas on how to improve it.  As a pilot, they decided to start on Calle 11, a street that included several elements of the &#8220;problem&#8221; (bien cuidados, garbage, illegal parking, broken sidewalks between others).  This is what they did:</p>
<p>With help from all the residents in the street, a plan was designed to park in a nearby lot, so that the cars wouldn´t be on top of the already broken sidewalks. Instead of cars, and to prevent further illegal parking, big plant pots were installed in place. Residents would take care of them, paid by the businesses in the street. Some of them have already started working with a local parking company as &#8220;parking guides&#8221;, guiding visitors to the parking lots and preventing chaos.  They will be fully identified and in uniform.</p>
<p>Each area was given beautiful garbage cans to use (as they didn´t have them). Also, the traffic flow of the street was changed to improve overall circulation between the two connecting avenues.  Voilà!</p>
<p>Sounds simple, but it was an amazing pilot that was only possible with the full cooperation almost guerrilla style from everyone including the authorities.  The SPI and Tránsito were unbelievably helpful, and so were the people in the street. Here are photos of before and after, but even if you can´t see the mess or the importance of the difference, people living there do know.  Just to give you a hint: now the street is usable. The first thing they did when it was clean was to &#8230;. actually start using it! they took out a barbeque on the weekend, children could play without garbage up to their noses. Now the lady who sells fried patacones has a really nice spot to put tables and chairs, so her local business can grow, fueled by clients who now will be attracted (and able) to walk up this street in search for more restaurants.</p>
<p>What are the next steps? they are working in setting up a training program for the local youth in the street who are looking to be able to apply for better jobs.  Also, the association is looking forward to extend the programs to other areas where the authorities have detected illegal parking which is creating problems for everyone.  The best thing is that these plant pots can now be an urban garden project, helping residents from each street grow their own herbs and vegetables.</p>
<p>There where so many helping hands in this project, it really took a village!</p>
<p>Here the main participants, keep in mind that each street will have a new group involved:</p>
<p>Businesses:</p>
<p>Rana Dorada, Mojitos, Onplog, Las Clementinas, Conservatorio S.A., Casco Parking, Diablo Rosso, Papiro y Yo, Amicale, Los Cuatro Tulipanes, Pensión Panamericana</p>
<p>Hands on!</p>
<p>Juan Londoño, Ricky Sandoval, Johann Wolfshoon, Kc Hardin, Zaira Lombardo, Eric Theise, Matt Landau, Ricardo Garcés, Cherie Flagg, Itav Avital, Scott y su team de construcción, Franz (mover los potes), Rogelio Jaramillo, Marteen, Jennifer Hotsko and Fábrega</p>
<p>Government authorities:</p>
<p>SPI: Sub Comisionado Cenèn Castillo &amp; team</p>
<p>Tránsito: Lic. Carlos Ayuso</p>

<p>Interesting article about Cartagena, Colombia`s colonial town. Because it started its revitalization before Panama`s historic district of Casco Antiguo, it is probably one of the best cases to show the path of evolution of historic real estate in the region.  For those of you who have followed prices and trends through Arco`s blog and listings in Casco Viejo, I`m sure you will find this reading extremely interesting.  One of the easiest things to compare is always the price range per restored mt2. Qualities being similar, Panama`s Casco Viejo is still between $2500 to $3000 (in the case of commercial spaces and some really special homes) per mt2, while in Cartagena for a similar level of restored home is difficult to find a product below $5000 per mt2. A lot of this value rocketed when hotels like the famous Santa Clara &#8220;hit town&#8221; and opened doors in Cartagena. Similarly, Panama is about to experience the same dynamics with all the hotels opening doors at the ends of 2013, specially the American Trade Hotel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo</p>
<p>The Guayabera is a classic image of tropical elegance. Usually associated with Cuba, many don´t know it has always been very popular in Panama because it has a flair that reminds us of our traditional &#8220;camisilla&#8221;.  I remember being always envious of those fresh shirts men got to wear, until recently, when &#8220;Panabrisa&#8221; started making dresses for women on the same style. Loved them!</p>
<p>So you can imagine my enthusiasm when &#8220;Guayaberas&#8221;, the store that carries <a href="http://www.panabrisa.com/">Panabrisa</a> (a brand with more than 50 years designing and selling guayaberas) showed an interest in Casco Viejo. After a lot of back and forth, specially putting up with the repairs of the roads in the area, finally they took a big step yesterday and opened their doors to the public.  I rushed in and grabbed my ticket to be the first customer!</p>
<p>They have really nice stuff, from the classic male models to dresses (and if you ask they also have baby guayaberas!).  Also they have pillow cases, bags and other products like designed hats and jewerly by Annie Chajin.</p>
<p>Go check them out! where? corner of 4th and A Avenue, in front of Arco! Miriam Pons will be there to help you choose or take special requests (miriam@guayabera.net )</p>
<p>Visit them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/panabrisa.albertopons?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts">Facebook</a></p>
<p>And see their product here:</p>

<p>A while ago I started to make my own Christmas Tree using recycled stuff. This obsession has now spread to other holidays, and today I`m trying with Easter.  What I like about this small project is that it took literally nothing, it was fun to do and gave me instant gratification. My kind of thing!</p>
<p>These rocks I picked up at Casco`s beach in Calle 4ta, painted them last night and made the nest with some palms I found around. Voila! Looking forward to the next holiday&#8230;</p>

<p>Last night we enjoyed a fantastic sunset at the roof terrace of Capital Bistro Panama, the new restaurant in Casco Viejo, and the only one directly off Plaza V Centenario. What a killer position! Views of modern Panama City and Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>Modern decor inside, they seem to be leaning towards tapas. My best picks so far have been the &#8220;Mero&#8221; and the &#8220;Robalo&#8221; (Snook).  They also have a beautiful chocolat fondant!</p>

<p>One of the founders of Arco Properties had a passion for antique furniture. I learned a lot from him, developing an eye for interesting stuff hidden in the houses in the barrio. I always thought there would be a good niche for an &#8220;antique stuff&#8221; district in Panama, and that it should logically be in Casco Viejo. Well, I think I got my wish! little by little&#8230;</p>
<p>That place is Plaza Arango. A few steps away from <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a>, you will find now three antique vendors, one beside the other. The oldest one in the street basically has no name, you just bounce into it. He has a good collection of silver spoons, forks and then the classic bottles, water pitches, etc. Old records too!</p>
<p>Next to it, and the newest in the block is a &#8220;garage sale&#8221; of antiques. Big and small furniture, including the classic sewing machines that make for beautiful desks and tables. They even have a barber chair!</p>
<p>To its left you can find Canal Zone. Probably the best window and wider collection. They have plenty of things from the old Canal Zone times, so you can mix and match.</p>
<p>Now you can stroll and shop for antiques in Casco, fantastic! as it would be anywhere in the world, remember always to bargain!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Santa Ana</p>
<p>Teatro Amador is a beautiful theater located in Santa Ana, just after the traffic light.  It always caught my imagination because of my father`s stories about his childhood. He used to go there to watch movies (at some point it was both theater and movie theater), specially Flash Gordon. For $0.15 a day, you could stay there for hours, because first would be the news, then a raffle or similar and finally the movie. </p>
<p>Finally, the theater has been restored and it is breaking several marks in one: it is the first privately restored theater and the first renovated building in Santa Ana, marking a new era for the area. </p>
<p>This Friday, the soft opening will be dedicated to Casco Viejo`s neighbors, specially members of the AVACA group.  We are glad to see new and interesting concepts entering the area, and very specially history being brought back!</p>
<p>Needless to say&#8230;. I`m taking dad to the opening! can´t wait!!! </p>

<p>March is always the backdrop for Panama`s two week long spring. With the first rains, all the trees bloom. Last week, as coordinated by an invisible orchestra director, all the &#8220;robles&#8221; tuned in together playing the exact note of pink. People sat around and under the trees, but I took a photo of this cute cat sleeping in the middle of the flower carpet.  It looked so comfortable!!!</p>

<p>This weekend, the whole country will go upside down. Almost everyone in Panama City will travel to the country side, in a massive exodus to celebrate until Wednesday all they can celebrate. Many will be with their families, and towns like Las Tablas, Penonomé and just anything with beaches will be the primary destinations.</p>
<p>This year we`ll stay behind, in Casco Viejo, and enjoy the almost unbelievable transformation of an entire capital gone ghost town! What we`ll do in Casco? probably join the kids who will run after anyone they see with a bucket of water and throw it on top just to run and hide (or not even hide but laugh their heads off). The second best attraction is to see the improvised band that always ends up in Calle 4ta and Calle 5ta playing with anything they can find (bottles, boxes, frankly, anything)!.  They can actually sing! even after beer&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo</p>
<p>Yesterday was Idalibeth and Doña Mary`s Christmas Party.  Every year, they host a party for the neighborhood kids, an event that has grown from being in someone`s borrowed patio to the big Plaza Centenario. At least a hundred kids attend, from all ages: they know each other from school, from their street, from the afterschool programs they attend (like Enlaces or Aprojusan).  Three things are common denominators in all of them: they are from the neighborhood, they are kids, and their parents belong or live nearby a gang (or former gang).</p>
<p>This party means a lot to Idalibeth and eventually as these kids grow it will mean a lot to them too. The idea behind the party, the entire reason for it to exist, was that Idalibeth &#8211; a former gang member wife- realized after going through social programs herself, that children couldn´t and shouldn´t be brought up with resentment, independently from each other, taking with them the supposed rivalries among gangs.  One street could not be against another forever and through their children. They had to have a platform to know each other, share, and grow up together.</p>
<p>Not many people know what a success story Casco Viejo has been in this sense. Back in the day there used to be gangs that couldn´t cross from a street to the other.  After going through social programs like Por una Esperanza in 2006, those gangs ceased to exist through the most powerful weapon: education. Now on this stage, their former members are taking steps to prevent going back to square one by teaching their children how to be together.</p>
<p>The party is the result of the involvement of a lot of people. This year, the junior swimming team joined. Thanks Fanny! and Thanks to Doña Mary and Idalibeth for having the vision, taking these steps and keeping it up.</p>
<p>What a great holiday gift!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>This year, Casco Viejo`s neighborhood association AVACA celebrated its third anniversary.  It is called AVACA for its Spanish name: Asociación de Vecinos y Amigos del Casco Antiguo, and for three years it has been the voice of residents ,  businesses and lovers of this beautiful historic district. It`s membership is as diverse as Casco itself, with people from Panama and all over the world.  And its work is equally diverse: from the beautiful garbage tanks painted by local artists,  street and beach cleaning to educational campaigns at schools and government lobby, this group is hardcore and passionate about Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to see AVACA working together with other ngo`s like Sembrarte, Fundación Calicanto, Jardines Urbanos, Generation Peace Academy, among others.  They use sinergy wherever it is found to lift the bar and show how simple things can make a world of difference.</p>
<p>Here is part of the presentation given during its third year anniversary celebration.  If you wish to join, contact  <a href="mailto:director@avaca.org.pa">director@avaca.org.pa</a>  or send Arco an email and we`ll make sure to connect you.</p>

<p>This is my favorite Casco Crew: they work like crazy, but never seem stressed. It is the only crew I know that loves working 24 hours straight, delivers on time and the product normally comes out better than you imagined. What do they do? floats! Franz and his team can take on any project, no matter how simple or complicated. Creative team of guys, we love to say it`s international: one for every Panamanian province, plus a couple of Italians, USA and from time to time even a Latvian!<br />
This past weekend they were responsible for some big carts during Panama City`s Christmas Parade. Here are some photos. They produced anything from dinosaurs to elves. I think I even saw Scooby Doo somewhere&#8230;<br />

The love that went into it, and the accuracy of its models makes this a great gift for Casco fans or Panama fans. Ida Vallarino worked small models of the houses, based on photos and her experience. Amazing. My favorites? you`ll see here Las Clementinas (of course!) but also a Panamanian curiosity that makes sense only to female Panamanians: the first Felix B Maduro store. Can you guess where it was? I do&#8230; </p>
<p>The book is for sale at Felipe Motta, go check it out!<br />

<p>What is great about this time of the year is that people take time to spend it together and share with others.  Here are some photos of the small parties I`ve seen in the neighborhood, from local ngo`s that work with kids.  Some of these are from Pot to Plate and some from Aprojusan.</p>

<p>Saril, the vibrant red spicy juice every Panamanian loves to drink in Christmas time! for the first time I was able to grow the plant in my backyard, and finally drink 100% &#8220;organic&#8221; saril!!!  I didn´t even know how to make it, as there is this mystic about the recipe, but Mario, the town painter who is from Chiriquí and loves to plant told me to boil the flowers as if I was making tea with a bit of giger and clove.  I didn´t have clove, but ginger I have always tons in the house.</p>
<p>Did it yesterday&#8230;. beautiful!</p>
<p>He said it was good &#8220;for the blood&#8221;, so I had to google it&#8230; and here is Wikipedia (of course) with tons of information of this plant that is called so many different names around the world:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roselle_%28plant%29">Wikipedia here.  </a>Conclusion: apparently it is being used for a lot of stuff, not limited to: anti hipertension, cardiac diseases, laxative, diuretic, and it is &#8220;claimed to heal sores in camels&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wao!</p>

<p>Paul Gauguin lived in Panama in 1887, during the construction of the French Canal.   Living in &#8220;Panama&#8221;, of course, meant to live in &#8220;Casco Viejo&#8221;, which was the only thing going at the time. Eventually he decided for the island of Taboga. Eventually, he moved out altogether, and head to Tahiti where he would paint his famous and colorful paintings.</p>
<p>This week, the Canal Museum in Casco Viejo opened an exhibition on Paul Gauguin that will be shown until March.  Letters, paintings, drafts, and a peek on the life of the radical genius.</p>

<p>Chef Mario Castrellón has joined hands with Fundación Calicanto, creating the first Fonda/School in Casco, a place where the foundation´s students can learn while serving delicious food.</p>
<p>Yesterday we went and tried several tapas, all of them really good. My favorite were the tacos with the spicy sauce and the absolute best the chocolate cake with hot caramel sauce. They will also be serving really affordable lunches: between $5 and $7, and soups from $3.50.</p>

In Casco, you have several places with great stuff, you can start by A Avenue! plus, the decorations are up and looking fantastic!</p>
<p>Don´t forget to visit UnderCover, Lupa, Reprosa,  No Me Olvides and Karavan! Papaya Planet has wondeful books, for both adults and children. Chocolate boxes with spicy bombons at Oro Moreno.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo</p>
<p>Remember jumping rope,  racing through car tires and doing balancing games on top of logs? These were some of the games that Eco Creando worked out last week with children from Aprojusan, mixed with a small art workshop where they learned how to turn plastic bottles into small jewelry boxes. In a world where everything is based on computer games and kids are less and less into physical activities,  I believe this is an important link to being a healthy kid and future balanced adult.</p>
<p>This is the kind of small stuff that happens every day here and that makes it so exciting. It is the sum of all of those volunteers and programs that are making the difference. Love it! Congratulations to Diana and all her friends from Eco Creando, and to Gio with her team from Aprojusan!</p>

<p>The Golden Frog is one of Panama`s icons and valuable amphibians . It is also the name of Casco Viejo artisanal beer pub at the entrance of San Felipe.  Now, you know the joke about putting a frog inside a beer glass&#8230; wait a second, I think that wasn´t exactly it. Well&#8230; doesn´t matter!</p>
<p>The important thing is that today we are celebrating the Golden Frog Day along with all the frog specialists in Panama. Raise awareness and raise a glass of good beer tonight at the Rana Dorada in Casco Viejo in support of their scientific research.</p>
<p>Here is the info:</p>

<p>Every day I learn something new.  I learned that the word &#8220;photo&#8221; had a Greek origin and meant something like &#8220;writing with light&#8221;.  &#8220;Esquina Photo&#8221;, Casco Viejo`s new business inaugurated last week celebrating this concept by taking photos of all the guests at their &#8220;dark room&#8221; like gallery writing words in the air using luminescent tubes. The photos came out great!</p>
<p>The gallery`s concept is interesting: they`ll have affordable, interesting photography from good amateurs from around the world.  They will be able to carry professionals as well, but the idea is that visitors will be able to take home a quality gift at an affordable price.</p>
<p>They are located at the corner of Calle 1era and A Avenue and is run by Ingrid Moore (<a href="mailto:imoore@esquinaphoto.com">imoore@esquinaphoto.com). </a></p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo</p>
<p>As the historic city moves on with its restoration, opportunities to buy nice two and three bedroom apartments in the $300,000 range become rare.  This is one of the many reasons why we like Mano de Tigre, Conservatorio`s most recently launched project in Plaza Herrera. You can get two bedrooms starting at $312,000 and even some of them are convertible into three. But those will go in another posting, today we`ll check out the two bedrooms only.</p>
<p>First, the main facade with a summary of how many bedrooms and prices:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-6655" href="http://arcoproperties.com/2012/08/buying-a-two-bedroom-in-casco-viejo-for-less-than-350000/i/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6655" title="i" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/i-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/i-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/i.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Now, let`s see how the first level works:  each apartment at Level 00 has actually two levels: 00 and 100.  So you enter to your apartment through level 100 where you will find the kitchen, living room, dining room and the master bedroom and bathroom.  Then, you go down the stairs, and you find the laundry and the second bedroom &amp; bathroom.  This area also has a small patio that brings light into the level.</p>
<p>Here is an example: Apartment 1 &#8211; $312,000 &#8211; Area: 127.57 mt2</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-6656" href="http://arcoproperties.com/2012/08/buying-a-two-bedroom-in-casco-viejo-for-less-than-350000/mano-de-tigre-2bdr/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6656" title="Mano de Tigre 2bdr" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mano-de-Tigre-2bdr-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mano-de-Tigre-2bdr-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mano-de-Tigre-2bdr.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>All the units on this level work the same way.  Units 1 and 3 have two bedrooms, Units 2 and 4 are two bedrooms convertible into three.</p>
<p>The other interesting two bedroom is Unit No. 7 at $345,000 &#8211; Area 104.50 mt2</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-6657" href="http://arcoproperties.com/2012/08/buying-a-two-bedroom-in-casco-viejo-for-less-than-350000/mano-solo-1-y-2-rec_pagina_09/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6657" title="Mano solo 1 y 2 rec_Página_09" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mano-solo-1-y-2-rec_Página_09-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mano-solo-1-y-2-rec_Página_09-300x229.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mano-solo-1-y-2-rec_Página_09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This one is located on Level 200 and has views to the colonial wall and gardens. The balcony is spacious enough to have a nice breakfast table out, and the floorplan as you can see is all in one level.</p>
<p>Another advantage of Mano de Tigre is that all units will have the ability to rent a parking space at the property next door, which is very convenient and highly desirable in a historic city!</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about Mano de Tigre, don´t hesitate to contact us for a free brochure:  clara   or    patrizia    @arcoproperties.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo</p>
<p>So you have a neighbor who never takes care of his/her property. Is an empty lot which always ends up full with garbage, overgrown grass and who knows what.  You`ve tried to get in touch with the owner, but nothing gets too much of their attention. You could call the authorities, but, let`s face it, after the fine, it all goes back to square one again because it is an absentee owner, someone who doesn´t live here.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>Transform it with art! make it into something positive that the community can use instead of being a receptacle for graffiti and garbage. Make it pretty!</p>
<p>In a flash intervention, Sembrarte, Aprojusan, Jardines Urbanos and AVACA transformed this empty lot on Sunday.  Kids led by artist Rolo de Sedas painted tires and helped planting the garden. Volunteers erased the graffiti with paint, and helped put the tires up.  More ideas are flowing: let`s put a bench, etc.  This was just the first step.</p>

<p>Who didn´t read all those Agatha Christie novels where a group of people go to dinner and one gets murdered? it is a classic of all times: one of the guest did it, just we don´t know who he/she is.   When the detective shows up he/she finds that everyone in the room had a reason to kill the victim. Exciting!</p>
<p>Just as in an episode of Murder She Wrote, Casco Viejo will have it`s first Murder Mystery Dinner! Get &#8220;killed&#8221; and support a good cause while at it&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsroompanama.com/theater/4579-a-killer-night-out-with-all-the-extras.html">All the details here including menu! </a></p>
<p>Where? At Magnolia Inn</p>
<p>Why? It is fun (if you survive) and you support the Carols by Candlelight Christmas event.</p>
<p>How much?$40 includes dinner</p>
<p>When? September 17, 18, 19</p>

<p>A friend just sent me an article by Trulia Inc. expert Jed Kolko about the slow recovery of the real estate market mainly in the US.  It is a well balanced article, so I thought on sharing it with you.</p>
<p>It was interesting what Mr. Kolko had to say about markets like New York and San Francisco. His message was that areas where product was limited, beautiful and desired (or productive) would keep appreciating over time.  Proportions guarded, that`s the way we feel about Casco Viejo, Panama.</p>
<p>Being a historic district where availability of product will always be on the &#8220;limited edition&#8221; category, Casco Viejo also shares characteristics such as being one of the most beautiful and interesting places in Panama City. Also it is one of the only walking districts (if not the only one).  In short, is a niche within a niche, where your investment will likely grow organically in time.</p>
<p>Here is the article, we hope you enjoy it:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo</p>
<p>Being part of a community is why Casco Viejo appeal to so many.  It is a place that welcomes volunteering, where you can make a difference with your own hands, from helping your neighbor`s kid to spay his dog to participate in bigger projects like beach and street cleanings.</p>
<p>Two great examples happened these past two weeks: a big beach cleaning involving the already &#8220;famous&#8221; Green Patrol (a group of children from Casco who patrol the streets raising awareness about garbage and recycling) and today, a massive garbage tank painting by volunteers from the company Diageo.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-6557" href="http://arcoproperties.com/2012/07/live-love-learn-casco-viejo-cool-volunteering/ready/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6557" title="ready" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ready-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ready-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ready-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-6557" href="http://arcoproperties.com/2012/07/live-love-learn-casco-viejo-cool-volunteering/ready/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6557" title="ready" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ready-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ready-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ready-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The results provide with immediate satisfaction: the beach is a great playground for young and adults alike, plus are a tourism attraction.  And now, thanks to Diageo volunteers and their &#8220;Learning for Life&#8221; team, Casco Viejo will doble the number of garbage cans available in the historic city, each one painted by a volunteer and Panamanian artists.  Two goals in one shot: to help clean while inspiring with beauty.</p>

<p>Most people that has been following up Casco Viejo know how difficult it is to find spacious units, specially over two bedrooms.   You basically have to build your own home from scratch using quite a large property to get beyond that. That is quite normal in historic districts, where there are very limited opportunities to develop larger homes, and this is what makes Mano de Tigre exceptional, among other things.</p>
<p>Spacious one bedrooms that are enjoyed all in one level,  two bedrooms that can grow with you as your family grows and starts needing a third space, and three bedrooms with a maids quarter for those in need of larger spaces.</p>

<p>What we love about this project:</p>
<p>History and Location:</p>
<p>Near Plaza Herrera, it gets its name from the historic piece of the city wall displayed right in front. A unique and charming view!  It is easy to get to and leave from.  Also, the entire plaza is under construction. Some of Panama´s best hotels are going to be located here, which will bring appreciation to the entire Casco, but of course touching first the immediate surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Small parks and plaza parks are a few steps away.  The Boyacá gardens provide with great outdoors space where kids can run around and play and be safe from traffic.  Plaza Herrera is next door, and is one of Casco`s biggest and most beautiful plazas.</p>

<p>Right in front of Boyacá, two interesting NGO`s: the <a href="http://fundaciondaniloperez.org/">Danilo Pérez Foundation</a> and <a href="http://fundacionolgasinclair.org/">Olga Sinclair Foundation.</a> The first one teaches jazz to children and young talents in the neighborhood, many of which have ended earning scholarships to study and play abroad.  The second one is run by one of the best known Panamanian painters and  teaches painting to children in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Amenities:</p>
<p>The building has an elevator .  Units on the first two levels have patios that open to the guest bedroom, which makes for an interesting floor plan that provides with flexibility and privacy.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000IZOzkAAH">Apartment 1</a> ,  <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000IZOzuAAH">Apartment 2</a> , <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000IZP0vAAH">Apartment 3</a> , <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000IZP1FAAX">Apartment 4</a></p>
<p>Apartments No. 2 and No. 4 are specially interesting because they have two bedrooms and a den that could be easily convertible into a three bedroom.</p>
<p>Looking to avoid stairs? then the second level is for you.  All the floor plans here are at one level,  and all of the apartments here have spacious balconies.  There is one for each flavor: <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000IZP1KAAX">1 bdr</a> (Unit 5) , <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000IZP1UAAX">2 bdr </a> (Unit 7) , <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000IZP1PAAX">3 bedr</a> (Unit 6).</p>

<p>Have you ever been to <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas?</a> (if not, click on the link! or go try its brunch, is really good!).  The finishes will be the same as the ones used in their suites.  You`ll be able to experience how its beautifully done hardwood floor with reclaimed wood from Panama`s Canal brings all the Casco Viejo charm up.</p>

<p>Casco Viejo, 6:30 a.m. Looking at the ocean and beautiful Las Bóvedas. Juan Gomez, <a href="http://www.espaciokaruna.blogspot.com/">Espacio Karuna`s </a>yoga instructor and Thai massage specialist is giving a relaxation technique class based on breathing.  Surrounded by the ocean breeze and sounds, we breathe in and breathe out, belly in, belly out.  Half hour of this, strangely, I didn´t grow dizzy but relaxed.  I wanted to go straight back to bed, but instead, I walked back home for a nice fruity breakfast.  And then walked to my office.</p>
<p>These are the small daily miracles I love from living and working in Casco Viejo! No matter what comes afterwards, my day already has positive colors and ribbons on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is always fun to find photos of early Casco Viejo and try to match it with today`s Casco.  This postcard seems to be from the early republic, and the corner of 12th with Santa Ana`s church at the back can only be what today is known as the corner of Café Coca Cola (well, not the café itself, but the Pio Pio behind, see the pink property at the corner).</p>
<p>So here it is! before and after&#8230;. my vote goes to the original design because even if more simple, it had an extended roof that offered protection from the rain.  What do you think?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>A friend just brought me <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2111709,00.html">Time Magazine`s April </a>edition featuring Panama on its travel section.  And guess what? big photo of Casco Viejo to illustrate what a perfect day in Panama City should look like.  And we agree!</p>
<p>Waking up early and walking to Ancon Hill, starting at Casco, towards Central Avenue  and then the old Canal Zone, hiking through a wonderful rainforest to be rewarded by toucans and one of the best views in Panama city at the top of Ancon Hill is the best way to get your day started: healthy and with tons of info on Panama`s natural and cultural &#8220;must see&#8221;.  Total time: 2 hours.</p>
<p>And then, there is Casco, with its wonderful offer of interesting places to eat, drink and experience. Thumbs up!</p>

<p>Today is the last day of the International Film Festival Panama (IFF Panama).  During a full week, Casco Viejo has been the host for all the red carpet galas, but also of an interesting initiative: the Casco Cineplex.</p>
<p>Using empty spaces, neighbors organized screenings for Italian movies (by Di Vino) and children`s movies (by Arco Properties, Conservatorio and AVACA).  The &#8220;kids corner&#8221; was packed every night and movies ranged from Cirque du Soleil to Tin Tin and Monster`s Inc.  People walking by couldn´t resist but visiting, sometimes with kids, dogs and more!</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone that helped this mini project be a success!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Canal Museum in Casco Antiguo, Fundacion Calicanto celebrated the 18th graduation of their CAPTA program.  This program prepares women from the neighborhood to work as house keepers in hotels, but it actually gives them much more:  the full cycle includes self esteem modules that help them effectively break the cycle of poverty.  From personal finances to emotional intelligence,  it lights a small flame of hope that now can grow with them and extend to their families.</p>
<p>Each graduation has 20 women, which means the program has transformed the lives of 360 families.  Thanks to all the donors and to the people in Calicanto that makes it happen.   If you wish to learn more about the foundation, donate or volunteer,  <a href="http://www.fundacioncalicanto.org/">check them out HERE. </a></p>

I remember being amazed at the machinery, the beautiful tanks and pipes&#8230; and the product was a lot of fun! Guess what? now we have one in Casco Viejo! check out La Rana Dorada:</p>
<p>Located in front of the Centenario park in Casco Viejo, just at the very entrance to San Felipe, it has an outdoors terrace, so you can bring your dog! (always appreciated for all of us dog owners!).  The space is well done, but the commanding piece is the beer brewery.  Fantastic! they produce all sorts of combinations, they even had one that tasted like orange.  Yes, and if you doubt it does taste like orange, you better go and try it yourself.</p>
<p>Contact info: 269-2989/ 269-2990.  Please note these phones are from La Rana Dorada in Vía Argentina, but they can take your reservations.</p>

It is one of my favorite places to get small gifts when I travel (and just for myself).  They have a beautiful collection of things ranging from jewelry made with recycled materials (even fish scales, which was the traditional way to make jewelry in Panama) to organic honey, woven bags and hand made greeting cards.</p>
<p>Papiro y Yo is at the back of Hotel Central, you`ll bump into their handmade hats and bags &#8230; no risk of getting lost! Here are some photos:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>This weekend, a special event put in the map of young Panamanians two historic towns that are also UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Panama La Vieja and Casco Viejo.  Gabo Castillo from Hip Magazine and clothing designer Annie Chajin decided to do a &#8220;man to man&#8221; (or woman?) competition to see who could get the best party going. Gabo picked Panama La Vieja and Annie kept her turff at Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>It was a complete success, both towns were filled up with people that came from everywhere.  Casco Viejo offered probably the best package: the &#8220;ruta del Casco&#8221; (the path of Casco) included special offers and discounts on several restaurants and bars.  But the most important thing was that this event brought light to both cities, who are separated by land but intimately joined by their history and value as they are both World Heritage Sites.</p>
<p>Congratulations for Gabo and Annie!</p>

<p>Bill Bytsura has been a Casconian for quite a while now.  You can see him backstage at the Panama Jazz Festival or walking around Casco Viejo with his professional camera around his neck.  The material I always saw from him was related to the Panama Jazz Festival (by the Danilo Perez Foundation), but this week, he sent me this link with his photos published in a very special article: &#8220;Pictures from a Battlefield&#8221; which talks about the people who started fighting AIDS almost twenty five years ago.</p>
<p>The photos are amazing capturing all the love and courage of this group, as inspiring as the article. Check the article out here: http://nymag.com/news/features/act-up-2012-4/</p>
<p>And congratulations to Bill for being part of such wonderful effort and sharing it with us!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Yes, you read correctly, no need to adjust your screen: Casco Viejo has finally managed to get its own passport!</p>
<p>For me as a Panamanian is extremely funny, because being such a small country we do have a separatist province called Chiriquí. There, the &#8220;claim&#8221; for a new country has translated into the funniest merchandise ever, which of course includes their own &#8220;Chiriquí Passport&#8221;, their flag and so on.  For the longest time I`ve repressed thoughts of Casco doing the same, but not anymore! From now on, I declare myself Casco-Centric (not that you wouldn´t have noticed that before in my blog), but now I`m out in the open and shameless about it: We have a cool passport that on top of being cute gives you great access to what`s going on here!</p>
<p>This passport is a beautiful small booklet called  &#8220;Casco`s Route&#8221; and includes discounts and offers on a lot of Casco Viejo restaurants and businesses. It will be launched on the 30th of March, at 4 p.m. at Habana Panama, which will include a cool party afterwards until 11 p.m.  If you already have a passport, don´t forget to bring it,  you`ll be eligible for prizes!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Imagine this: sixty five journalists/ publishers/ marketing &amp; sales staff from one of the most prestigious travel magazines in the world come to Panama.  They want to see Panama in a nutshell: the most authentic pieces we have to offer in less than three days.  Not &#8220;mission impossible&#8221;!  Panama has plenty to offer, but such a logistic needed a special strategy.</p>
<p>Groups were divided into &#8220;Quests&#8221; where each group had a specific task, like a game, of finding something, bringing something, eating something, building something, exploring something.  Groups went everywhere, from the Embera villages in Chagres, to shopping day in Salsipuedes. From learning about our most traditional foods by buying them at the public market and the fish market (then cooked by a wonderful Panamanian chef) to having the real &#8220;tailor of Panama&#8221; who lives in Chorrillo make guayaberas and Panama Hats for everyone. From hiking Cerro Ancón to boxing at the spartan boxing gym in Chorrillo where most Panamanian boxing stars still train. From a beautiful dinner at the Trump Hotel to a street party in Casco Viejo, featuring arroz con pollo and tamales, drinks by local snowcone man (raspao) who managed to make mojitos, piña coladas and daiquiris &#8211; raspao version. From modern city to old city to  jungle and back.</p>
<p>Photos taken by all participants in every quest were put into a slide presentation that was shown at the street party, and it was beautiful to see our Panama through the eyes of Travel and Leisure experts.  They managed to capture the essence of what makes this country special, the diversity, but above all, it was a celebration of authenticity.  They were not captured by luxury nor towers, but by grass roots reality which they found to be fascinating.</p>
<p>I hope ACP reads this blog and realizes we need to nurture and cherish all things authentic in this country.  To know that Panama has to run away from &#8220;Disneyfication&#8221;!</p>
<p>Thanks so much to everyone who participated leading and organizing the quests. From the <a href="http://www.trumphotelcollection.com/panama/?_vsrefdom=tp-ppc">Trump Hotel</a> to <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a>,  <a href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/">Canal House</a> and <a href="http://www.elotrolado.com.pa/webes/">El Otro Lado</a>,  to <a href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/">Conservatorio</a> (organizers), Blanca (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Casona/37423518375">La Casona</a>) and <a href="http://www.enotecadivino.com/">Di Vino</a> (for saving us on the street party night when we ran out of wine!)

<p>Something we love about December in Casco are its cultural events. Yesterday, we went to the art show &#8220;Small Voids&#8221; from artist Mariana Núñez at Papaya Planet.  It is a very intimate, moving work not only for those who know her and her husband Hein, but for every woman facing similar circumstances. Highly recommended, it will be up until December 15th.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama , Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>There is a lot going on in Casco! little by little, the City has been inaugurating several important infrastructure work that really makes a difference in our daily lives. For example, the inauguration of Plaza 5 de Mayo, which is part of the wider renovation of the pedestrian part of Central Avenue in Santa Ana, and the Santa Ana Plaza (already under construction, and I think almost ready to deliver by now).</p>
<p>Also in Santa Ana, but towards A Avenue, another major project is already under construction: the complete renovation of Plaza Amador, including sports facilites for our famous soccer team and a brand new pool. Here for details: <a href="https://mupa.gob.pa/noticias/estadio-de-plaza-amador-tendra-nueva-cara-luego-de-una-consulta-ciudada">Plaza Amador,</a></p>
<p>Also, a couple of days ago, they announces a <a href="https://mupa.gob.pa/noticias/la-ciudad-de-panama-inaugura-su-centro-de-operaciones-para-la-seguridad-ciudadana">camera security system for the city </a> including San Felipe and Santa Ana.</p>

<p>Who doesn´t like a good story? life around us is pretty much based on storytelling (do we call that marketing now? ejemm&#8230;). Truth is, there is a very deep connection that runs through us when engaged in telling a story, something that magically and immediately ties up teller and audience, and &#8211; if good enough- manages to live through the ages, whether someone ended up writing it somewhere or not. Story telling is powerful.</p>
<p>This week, Casco´s Play Group started a story telling activity at Casco´s bookstore café, Papaya Planet.  Initially,  kids will meet twice a month, around 4:30 p.m. and stories will be read in both Spanish and English. Maybe more languages, depending on volunteers!!! if you would like to join the group, let us know!</p>
<p>Here are some photos of the adorable first reading. Can you guess who was the first &#8220;StoryTeller&#8221;?</p>

<p>New kid in town! <a title="Tantalo" href="http://www.tantalohotel.com/">Tantalo Hotel </a>just opened doors this past week (soft opening).  Although their official debut is on March 16th, they are already hosting fashion events (like this Friday) at their roof terrace.</p>
<p>What makes it distinctive is its beautiful green wall inside (love it!) and the fact that each room has been decorated by a Panamanian artist.  It is lovely how each business in Casco Viejo is bringing a totally different angle and energy to our colonial city!</p>
<p>Location: B Avenue, between <a href="http://www.casadelhorno.net/">Casa del Horno Hotel</a> and <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas Hotel</a>. Right in front of <a href="http://www.casasucreboutiquehotel.com/">Casa Sucre Bed &amp; Breakfast</a> and the Escuela de Mexico.</p>

<p>Last night, casqueños gathered at L`Osteria, the new restaurant at Casa del Horno.  Beautiful calicanto stone walls give you a cozy ambiance: perfect for homemade Italian cuisine by chef Barbara.</p>
<p>L’osteria: from the Latin “hospes” meaning “guest”. A public place which  served drinks; traditionally wine.  Derived from the ancient Roman  “caupona”, in the Middle Ages the osteria was a place where the traveler  could find food and lodging.</p>
<p>So there you go! Initially, they`ll welcome guests just for dinner, starting at 6 p.m.  Once the  construction at B Avenue is finished, they`ll open for lunch.  Congratulations to Casa del Horno!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things I love about Casco is its eclectic community.  People from all around the World have come here to live and to bring the best of their culture.  This is the case of La Petite Bretagne, a small creperie that just opened at Central Avenue and 11th, next to the Lottery building and a couple of steps away from <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a>.  I had a wonderful honey and lemon crepe (with tea, of course!), a great way to end my afternoon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past Sunday, over 800 athletes from all around the world competed in the famous Ironman race.  Casco Viejo had two participants (Matt Landau and Eric Theise), which makes them officially the craziest of us all and without a doubt the best &#8220;in shape&#8221; people in town.   They finished the entire round: swimming, riding bicycle and running for a total of 70.3 miles.  Incredible!</p>
<p>On the cheering crowd we had the Casco Viejo IronMatt team, screaming to the top of our longs!  The official Ironman website commentator said that he had never seen so many people at any event in North or South America waiting at the finishing line, and I believe it, the place was packed.</p>
<p>To Eric and Matt&#8230; congratulations! you guys are amazing!</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun to see the crew running around filming all through Casco! Here is a recap I found, but you might want to tune in and see the episode. The shots of Panama were really nice!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.espaciokaruna.blogspot.com/">Espacio Karuna</a> is a space located inside the Los Del Patio art center, and Juan (the therapist) runs it.  He specializes in thai massage, which is a very &#8220;involved&#8221; massage where they manipulate your body, stretching it and lifting it.   He also does oriental massage which has a mix of techniques including Swedish massage.</p>
<p>I took the full thai massage to try it out. You need to go with comfortable clothing, like yoga clothing and have plenty of time.  It lasts almost 2 hours, and starts really slowly, so I fell completely asleep during the first part. As the stretching started, then I got to participate more and by the end of the massage my back was really feeling much better. However, if you feel you have knots deep in the muscle, you might want to do a more traditional massage or the oriental.</p>
<p>So, try it out! write your own review! Here is the info:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A project that started small is growing day by day. On Sunday, Casco Viejo`s Friends and Neighborhood Association (AVACA) along with Sembrarte carried out the fifth painting event for garbage tanks. The fourth event was donated by Hotel Herrera and this one by Estrella Azul.</p>
<p>Each event brings an even better quality of concepts, the tanks are coming out beautiful. The artists are organized by Rolando de Sedas from Sembrarte and the &#8220;official home of the Pintadera&#8221; is Villa Agustina at Plaza Herrera.</p>
<p>Next week, thirty tanks will be distributed throughout Casco Viejo,  providing a much needed space for garbage, but also a playful artistic spirit.</p>
<p>Thumbs up for everyone involved in this project!</p>

<p>Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo, Real Estate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following up with my last posting, I wanted to publish today some interesting data on how the private sector has evolved in Casco Antiguo since it was designated World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>It all really began with this designation in 1997. Before that, there were maybe a couple of restoration projects. By 1998 a number of them came along creating the first big push. the map shows the areas where this started to happen.  Through time, it is interesting to see not only the growing number of projects, but also how the &#8220;frontier line&#8221; of what was considered &#8220;safe&#8221; or even considered &#8220;Casco&#8221; began to move.</p>
<p>Today, with more than 20 projects under construction at the same time, the private sector is stronger than ever.  They are providing not only with a varied number of projects including hotels, residential and commercial, but also with social programs, job creation for the locals and support to community activities. They are becoming the voice of continuity, the heart of the economic momentum in Casco Viejo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Today, the government started to work on changing some of Casco`s sewage pipes and organizing electric cables and communication cables so that they are underground.  The street will be fixed after this along with the sidewalks on those areas. The works will cover most of A Avenue and 9th street which is the main entrance to Las Bovedas, and then a piece near the Presidential Palace and the Cathedral Plaza. These four areas at a cost of $39 million dollars.</p>
<p>While the community in general agrees that most of this work is necessary, they are lobbying the government to include more areas and to repair also the drinking water system, as it has several areas with important filtrations. This work has not yet been seriously considered and could potentially cause to re open all the streets again.   The community has also criticized the lack of coordination with the local businesses, especially those who live directly from tourism, as this is the peak of high season in Panama. They delivered the Office of Historic Patrimony a document with a down-to-earth and easy-to-apply program that will allow the businesses to continue working and even identified opportunities of promotion for the area.</p>
<p>Because of the traffic implications, the government  finally decided to put in practice a recommendation given by the community more than two years ago: they have given instructions to all government workers to park outside Casco Viejo and will be brought in by a shuttle.  This will continue during the year and a half the project is supposed to last.  After meeting with the Office of Historic Patrimony, the community was clear that this should be a permanent measure.   As many historic cities, parking should be for residents, commerce and tourism: the three pillars of the economy.</p>
<p>Here is a map marking the total extent of the work (in red) which will be carried out in 13 phases, through a year and a half.  If done well, Casco Viejo and Panama will gain from it.   If done wrong, an important opportunity will be missed.</p>
<p>In either case, we believe the private sector will keep on providing services and continuity.  With more than twenty projects already under construction and a growing number of businesses,  a sense of responsibility is on the raise.  On our next blog, we`ll present a survey showing how the private sector has been growing in the past fourteen years.</p>

<p>I really can´t tell why. Why do we care so very much about either Barza or the Real Madrid. I mean, after all, we are in Panama. Is it because we were a Spanish colony? don´t think so.  But we love them, and depending on which street you are in Casco Viejo you are either a Barza fan or a Real Madrid addict.</p>
<p>We were peacefully sitting at our Arco office, which happens to be steps away from a sports bar. At some point we heard this incredible screaming, like a pack of howler monkeys and then a lot of laughter.  I went out to see what was going on, people spilling from inside the place to the street, each one with a theory of what was happening.  The center of the dispute was that the game was still tied after quite a while, nobody could believe it.  And when it ended up tied, people where screaming even higher!!!</p>
<p>I don´t know if the Barza or the Real Madrid are aware of the crazy fans they have here.  Someone please send them this blog!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Antiguo, Panama, Casco Viejo</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/">Conservatorio S. A. </a>, a Casco Viejo developer and a <a href="http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/global-vision-awards-2011">Global Vision Award</a> winner, donated free space to the Danilo Perez Foundation to create their music school in Panama,  they had a clear idea of what they wanted.  Conservatorio had been looking for a way to raise the bar of the  neighborhood with the local neighbors, a vision that they were glad to find out was shared by  Danilo Perez, whose main objective was (and is) to create  social change through music.  Kids under his tutelage were turning out to be fantastic, they only needed an opportunity and a space to make it happen.</p>
<p>Almost four years later, the tree has started to bear fruit.  Children from the poorest areas in Panama, are now playing internationally or have started to play professionally in Panama through their recently formed bands. Talent is being harvested.  And, the most important part, they are teaching others. Spreading the seed of change.</p>
<p>Here is a beautiful article on how this school founded with a shared vision is helping underprivileged kids from all over Panama, but specially from Casco Viejo.  These are the success stories of team work and vision we need to see more out there:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I came across a while ago with the Spanish edition of The Economist, which normally gathers news of LatinAmerica (mostly focused on Central America, actually).  They ran an entire edition on companies that were more than a 100 years old, and Panama had featured two of them: the licor factory Varela Hermanos (103 years old) and the department store Felix B. Maduro (135 years old).</p>
<p>The Felix B. Maduro store was actually born in Casco Viejo in 1877 (we were part of Colombia back then), and it was called &#8220;Maduro &amp; Company&#8221;. Founded by Samuel and Esther Maduro, I have a friend looking for the first building they first occupied in Calle 8va, but the building most people remember as the cradle of the company is actually one they moved into in 1920`s next to the Cathedral, at Central Avenue, which now has plans to be restored as a boutique hotel.</p>
<p>An excellent location,  it is one of the tallest buildings around the area, but for me the &#8220;wao&#8221; factor was the big garden at the back. I can only imagine how beautiful this store most have been.</p>
<p>According to the article, today the company has more than a 1000 employees and has diversified. Now they have nine stores in Panama and have branched, specializing now in different areas such as toys, beauty and outlets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Saturday, Casco Viejo got flooded with wonderful music and music lovers.  Musicians included Tito Puente Jr, side by side with Panamanian students from the Danilo Perez Foundation.  When the festival started years ago (is it eight already?) they presented young talents that were just starting to receive education at the Foundation such as Milagros (see photo, already a teenager).  She must have been around five years old.   On Saturday, some of them already graduating, they presented a beautiful show along kids from well known music schools such as Berkley.</p>
<p>What I love about it is its mellow ambiance: everyone &#8220;hanging out&#8221;, meeting people from literally everywhere, every corner of Panama and the World.   Congratulations ot the organizers! enjoy the photos&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo</p>
<p>The Panama Jazz Fest is a wonderful event that gathers thousands of jazz lovers at the heart of Casco Viejo.  Getting there through the 300 year old streets might seem like a challenge, but it is really not! with a bit of planning, you can be a happy jazz fest attendant. Here are our tips on how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Park at Multicentro or Cinta Costera 1:  The organization will have a bus that will link Multicentro (in front of Paitilla) and people parking at Cinta.  So don´t even struggle with your car, park comfortably there and take the bus.  There will be several back and forth, until 10 p.m.  If you park at the Cinta, then just come up walking! Only taxis, residents and cars with special stickers will be able to come in.</p>
<p>2. Seating area:  if you like seating at the floor (like me), bring your matt. If not, a good idea is one of those chairs you can fold and fit in a bag.</p>
<p>3. Heat &#8211; Sun:  there are plenty of areas around to sit, some with more shade than others.  Bring your hat and sunblock!</p>
<p>4. Food and Beverage:  bring water with you! I`m sure you`ll need it. Don´t worry too much about beer because the Plaza will be closed  and they won´t allow you to get in with a cooler full of beers.  There will be people selling drinks and street food inside.  If you feel like taking a break and having a nice meal, there are several restaurants at the Casco (inside and outside Plaza Cathedral) that will be open with jazz offers for the day.</p>
<p>6. Public Bathrooms: there will be public bathrooms installed in the plaza, usually next to the Canal Museum.  Take your own toilet paper!</p>
<p>7.  Best time to arrive:   The event will start around 1 p.m. and finish at 8 p.m.  Anytime is a good time! If you really want a spot in front of the stage,  then arrive early (12 ish) .  If not, don´t worry, the music will invade the plaza wherever you are. What is great about this schedule is that it finishes relatively early so you can continue to enjoy Casco, &#8220;restaurant hopping&#8221;.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>

<p>Last year, we had the pleasure of being at <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas for New Years.</a> It was amazing, their rooftop terrace has almost a 360 degree view of Casco and Panama City.

<p>This year, Las Clementinas will open again its panoramic roof terrace.  Dinner will include a delicious menu featuring lobster and unlimited mimosas. It is the perfect spot if you don´t like crowds and prefer a more elegant, intimate ambiance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, &#8220;La Vecindad&#8221; was packed with children. Almost 200 kids running around, some jumping literally up and down. The party, which started a couple of years ago, was organized by Idalibeth, a local neighbor and supported by AVACA members.</p>
<p>What`s special about this party is that it joins kids from all parts of Casco Viejo, especially those who are sons and daughters of rival gangs deep into the poorest parts of Santa Ana.  Idalibeth herself was part of one of those gangs, until a social program showed her a better way. After that she became an entrepreneur with her mother, and ever since she took control of her own life, she has taken this party to help these kids make friends among them, blurring the imaginary frontiers that adults might still have in their heads. Many of those kids today are part of social programs as well: Enlaces (Calicanto), Aprojusan, Fundación San Felipe, Fundación Danilo Pérez, Fundación Olga Sinclair and even the Scouts.  Here is where the future is being made using all the right ingredients.</p>
<p>Congratulations Ida!</p>

<p>Dra. Patricia Chan is an unstoppable force. When you meet her, you know immediately you are in front of a non nonsense person with a deep commitment to the cause. And what a great cause: to clear the streets from unspayed animals, making for a healthier city and happier pets (and owners!).</p>
<p>This past Sunday, Spay Panama along with Angeles de los Animales and members from AVACA (Casco Antiguo`s Neighborhood Association) spayed about 60 animals (mainly dogs and cats).  The event was amazing, and it benefited neighbors that otherwise wouldn´t have had the means to operate their pets.</p>
<p>The event was held at the Santa Familia Community Center, at the space facilitated by Top Level Gym  Congratulations to everyone involved in this wonderful event!</p>
<p>If you would like to donate to Spay Panama, please contact <a title="Spay Panama" href="http://www.spaypanama.org/Contac.html">them HERE.</a></p>

<p>I`ve been having trouble to upload photos, but there has been so much happening! from the beautiful Carols by the Candlelight concert to small events that range from fashion (Miss Moss at the Casa de la Municipalidad) to small carols at Plaza Catedral by local NGO`s. </p>
<p>Today, a big neighborhood party will be happening at Calle 4ta, with more than 200 children from Casco Viejo. I hope I have more luck tomorrow uploading photos! this is a wonderful and pretty fun event, where children from every area of the historic city come together and share. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo<br />
Real Estate and History Panama</p>
<p>Panamanians will easily tell you that Panama`s population is a &#8220;crisol de razas&#8221;, an expression that means the country is a melting pot.  Because of our geographic location, Panama became a natural trading hub. It is been said that it was here were tribes from both north and south met to trade. It certainly served its purpose during colonial times, and even today Panama is considered the &#8220;hub of the Americas&#8221;.  As you may guess, this diversity showed in Panama`s culture and DNA, but there are very few places in Panama City where you can witness the architectural legacy of this melting pot better than in Casco Viejo. </p>
<p>Here is a clear example of this diversity: Casa de Abuela. </p>
<p>Even though Casco Viejo was &#8220;born&#8221; as a Spanish colonial city, the city itself was built and re built (it burnt three times almost to the ground) according to the influx of people that would come in waves to, for example, trade during the Gold Rush, build the French Canal, later with the American Canal.  So you find here not only colonial style architecture, but beautiful examples of everything else both in an almost &#8220;pure&#8221; form or fusion. </p>
<p>One of the least well known styles in Casco Viejo is the Caribbean Style.  Casa de Abuela is a beautiful and original example of Caribbean Style.  It has a unique shape, a wide balcony with water views. The house took advantage of the wind corridor that hits the corner where its located by introducing throughout the walls &#8220;respiraderos&#8221; (breathers) in addition to windows.  The upper level is double height and an attic at the roof serves as extra room but also as a flow for hot air to escape. </p>
<p>Records show the block existing since 1675, however, because Casco Viejo was caught in several important fires, records start mentioning this house around 1875. </p>
<p>Finding out a bit about 1875, and just to compare with what the World was doing back then, I find out that it was the year where George Bizet died and Camille Saint Saens premiered &#8220;Danse Macabre&#8221;, one of my favorite classical pieces. Panama was still part of Colombia.  </p>
<p>An interesting info, thinking about the style of the house and its prominent location nearby the Presidential compound and one of Casco Viejo`s main plazas, might be that in Panama, slavery was officially abolished in 1850`s.  The style and important location might be a witness of the actual roll that the black community, specially Afroantillians played in Panamanian society by then. Comparing, for example, to the United States at that time, I find out that still  in 1875 they were forming Anti Slavery Societies (New York), which was very much an issue that continued to be so for much longer in that country&#8230; but somehow not in Panama. As a matter of fact, by 1893 one of Panama`s most important poets was born: Gaspar Octavio Hernández, later referred as the &#8220;Black Swan&#8221; because of his origins and elegant writing style. He used to work as a journalist at La Estrella de Panamá, one of Panama`s most important newspapers of the day. </p>
<p>Looking at &#8220;Casa de Abuela&#8221;, looking at the year it was built, the place where it is, its tropical elegance and details,  I get the sense there is a hidden and beautiful history (if not lesson) behind it waiting to be discovered.   Only in Casco Viejo!</p>

<p>Two years ago, I started shifting from the traditional Christmas tree to ones made with recycled materials. The first year I made one with newspapers and miscellaneous stuff I found at the beach.  The second year, the theme was plastic bottles, also found at the beach. I used about 80 bottles or so on that one. Check out both photos <a href="http://panamacascoviejo.wordpress.com/2010/12/18/my-casco-eco-christmas-tree/">HERE.</a> This year, I thought it would be cool to do one with glass bottles, as glass looks always so elegant.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I live in front of Di Vino, a wine bar in Casco Viejo who handles all of their glass to Casco`s recycling center (on the other side of the street).  So all I had to do was to go there with a big bag and seat for 30 minutes and sort glass bottles out.  I`ve always been attracted to bottles, I have some old bottles from the Canal days and others that have weird or beautiful shapes. For my tree, I went with Perrier and Evian Pure bottles, because I liked their small and round shape.  I didn´t want the tree to be huge because of fear of my dog knocking it out.</p>
<p>So here it is! a work in progress&#8230; but looking quite good!</p>

<p>Casco Viejo`s Friends and Neighbors Association (AVACA) gathered last night at <a href="http://casadelhorno.net/eng/location.html">Casa del Horno</a> to celebrate Thanksgiving. At least four or five languages were being spoken in the party: Spanish, English, Italian, French and German.  And at least two dialects: Spanglish and Itañol.   A beautifully eclectic community celebrated and shared food among friends, children running everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice children here speak four different languages?&#8221; said Clara, my associate and lifeforce behind the party.  I looked around and saw them playing together and thought, well, somehow they are understanding each other pretty well!</p>
<p>The food was delicious and better yet among friends, Thanksgiving is a wonderful moment were new neighbors get to know old ones and in tune with what`s going on.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the organizers and thanks to Casa del Horno for lending AVACA its beautiful restaurant space!</p>

<p>Yesterday, under the rain, a group of residents in Casco Antiguo went out &#8220;guerrilla style&#8221; and distributed 18 beautiful garbage tanks decorated by Panamanian artists.  Like &#8220;positive art bombs&#8221;, the guerrilla group moved swiftly through A Avenue, in an almost military operation to inject the historic city with fun urban creativity.</p>
<p>This project belongs to <a title="AVACA" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/AVACA-Asociaci%C3%B3n-de-Vecinos-y-Amigos-del-Casco-Antiguo/123332294355801">AVACA, Casco Antiguo`s Neighborhood and Friend`s Association</a>, an organization that aims to see Casco Viejo become one of the greatest historic districts of the World.  From beach cleanings, to planting palms, Neighborhood Watch Program and even serve as a watchman for law enforcement, AVACA is usually involved in most of the community activities in Casco Antiguo.</p>
<p>The goal with this &#8220;Art -Tank&#8221; project is to help educate the public into disposing the garbage correctly, while providing with much needed tanks and beautifying the streets by injecting some great urban art.  Yesterday, already under the rain, locals were pointing out the cans and saying &#8220;look! look! wao!&#8221;. The cans were so pretty they thought twice about throwing garbage inside!</p>
<p>AVACA aims to collect enough funding to create 200 cans and be able to cover neighborhoods like Santa Ana.  So far,  in less than two months they`ve reached 40 cans and enthusiasm has grown.</p>
<p>Thumbs up to all the people who have helped and continue to help in this beautiful project!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holidays are basically here, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year&#8230; tons of things going on, and Casco Viejo isn´t the exception. However, many of the events held during this season in Casco Viejo are aimed to help the community, by either fundraising for a local ngo o directly doing something with the neighbors.</p>
<p>The first event of the season is really Thanksgiving, at the ends of November. This party is organized by members of AVACA, Casco Viejo`s Neighbors and Friends Association. It is a place to meet other neighbors and share wonderful food and wine. Every year, the party change places, normally featuring a new business, so that everyone gets to know it and welcome it.</p>
<p>For those of you who are living in Casco Viejo but are not yet part of AVACA, this would be a great opportunity to meet new people and learn about their programs. Joining is easy and their projects are fun. If you would like to go, please email us at: clara@arcoproperties.com  and save the date: November 24th.</p>
<p>For Christmas, there are all sorts of small and big initiatives.  But this year, the CanadaPLUS club is starting a &#8220;Candlelight Carol&#8221; that promises to grow year after year. All proceeds will go to Fundación Calicanto, a local ngo that works with women and children from the area.</p>
<p>The event will be absolutely delightful: an open air concert at Plaza Francia (Las Bovedas) with music by different choruses and the participation of the musicians from the Danilo Perez Foundation.  The event is on December 3rd, and will start at Plaza Catedral, where a procession of children carrying candles will walk all the way to Las Bovedas. And there, around 7 p.m. the concert will start.</p>
<p>For this event, there will be candles for sale, and you can reserve a good spot at the plaza (with a chair). Remember, all the proceeds go to Calicanto, so if you are thinking on coming, bring your family and friends!  For more information on this event, call David at 6689-6890 or email at clubcanadaplus@gmail.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>November is one of those &#8220;love `em or hate `em&#8221; months in Panama, mainly because we managed (don´t know how, really) to fit all of our patriot holidays in the same month, and as a result nobody really works, nothing moves. So, if you are planning to come to Panama for business either 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 28th of November, just don´t bother.  Also, please check if any of those fall close to the weekend, for if it does, don´t bother either. We call that &#8220;bridging&#8221;. I mean, what`s the point of showing up for work on a Friday if Thursday is a holiday and Monday too, right?</p>
<p>But, if you are coming to experience holidays in Panama, this is a great month.  You`ll see the city all dressed up, flags everywhere. Panama City pretty much empties for the first week and a half, everyone goes to the beach and mountains.  If you stay one day at Panama City you`ll see those classic parades where schools march forever, kids with proud faces playing at their best.  Being part of a music band here at school is a big thing, they practice all year round for those marches. But pretty much any town you`ll go they`ll have their own version. Small towns are wonderful, their &#8220;main plazas&#8221; are usually at the heart of the parade. You`ll see everyone in town, if you want to mingle with locals, this is when you do it.  Take an umbrella, it might rain!</p>
<p>When in town (or before coming to Panama), and even if you are already a seasoned &#8220;Panama &#8221; visitor, don´t miss the opportunity of reading &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Path_Between_the_Seas">The Path Between the Seas&#8221;.</a> It is a fascinating book, one of the best history books we`ve read about this country (and frankly, ever).   David McCullough is an amazing story teller, weaving facts with such natural disposition, you won´t be able to put the book aside. How a small country ended up in the middle of the World`s politics of its time, how it became independent without dropping one single drop of blood. Remarkable.</p>
<p>You`ll enjoy the country from a different perspective, and if you stay in our 300 year old colonial city called Casco Viejo, you`ll be literally walking the same streets that witnessed so many events.</p>
<p>Happy Patriot Holidays!</p>

<p>Trick or Treat! three beautiful kids knocked our door for some candy. Luckily I had some, so I wouldn`t be &#8220;attacked&#8221; by the fierce pirate or eaten by the Chinese-Ghost- Princess and her ballerina companion.  Maybe they would have turned me into a toad or something. And after several months of not missing my gym I would NOT want that!!!</p>
<p>Although Halloween is not a Panamanian tradition, we surely have plenty of ghost stories! Although it`s kind of unfair, Halloween`s origins seemed not to have had anything to do with it other than honoring ancestors and trying to scare away any bad spirits that would come with the change of seasons (Autumn to scary, cold, deadly, Winter).</p>
<p>Our ghost stories are less &#8220;nature&#8221; oriented, one of the most famous ones being the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscjsxeXfac">&#8220;Tulivieja&#8221;</a> which is supposed to be a woman that lost her baby at a river and ever since she roams the forests and homes in search for it. She is supposed to be &#8220;heard&#8221; crying at night (close to midnight, of course) and is said to take the infants at their sleep. One of the recommended measures to avoid the Tulivieja (or any witch) from taking you or whomever is to wear your clothes upside down.</p>
<p>So now you know! Here are the lovely ghosts that visited us yesterday. Happy Halloween to everyone!!!</p>

<p>During the 80`s and 90`s Casco Viejo fell to its lower point. Completely abandoned, it created a reputation as a dangerous place, not to be visited by anyone.  In 1998, when it got designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO the revitalization process started, and today, it hosts some of the finest homes, restaurants, bars and cultural events in the city.</p>
<p>The younger generations have started to &#8220;return&#8221; and inject their energy through art galleries and more. The most recent &#8220;injection&#8221; of love has been launched in the form of a website: Yo Amo Casco (I Love Casco), a site that promises to be a great place to find the latest on cultural events, nightlife and just life in Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>Check it out at: <a href="http://yoamocasco.com/sobre-nosotros/">I LOVE CASCO </a></p>

<p>Last night, the roof terrace at <a href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a> in Casco Viejo was the place to be.  A beautiful night, Casco Viejo neighbors and business owners were able to learn more about the upcoming International Film Festival that will be held in Panama next April 2012.   One of the most important announcements was that Panama`s government has officially given $1M to fund this important event, and now the opportunity is open for private businesses to participate.</p>
<p>The IFF Panama is being organized by Henk Van Der Kolk, founder of the <a title="Toronto Film Festival" href="http://tiff.net/thefestival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> who has now retired to Panama.

<p><a href="http://hacheuve.com/en/">Hache Uve,</a> one of the main restoration firms in Casco Viejo just got awarded on the &#8220;Restoration&#8221; category by Panama`s Architects and Engineers Association (<a title="SPIA" href="http://www.spia-pma.org/">SPIA</a>).</p>
<p>The &#8220;Premio Magno&#8221; was given for their work restoring <a href="http://hacheuve.com/proyectos/edificio-benedetti/">Benedetti Hermanos</a>, a Casco Viejo building from the 1920`s reflecting the Art Deco wave that made it into the colonial city and became part of its unique architectural eclecticism.  Many details from the original building were kept, sometimes even on its raw form to allow the building itself tell its story:  original stairs, glass elevator overlooking original bricks, the height of the apartments, and of course, the elegant facade which features a beautiful glass and wood commercial window which was rescued from historic photographs.</p>
<p>Here are some historic photos of the building and how it looks today. The developer, <a href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/">Conservatorio S.A.</a> , was recently awarded with the Global Vision Award (<a href="http://arcoproperties.com/2011/10/conservatorio-s-a-wins-global-vision-awards/">read more here</a>) and together with Hache Uve is now restoring what will be a fifty room hotel (<a href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=90&amp;Itemid=73">American Trade Hotel</a>) with an events space right in front.</p>
<p>Congratulations! Keep up the good work!</p>

<p>Casco Viejo is buzzing with activity. Construction everywhere, hotels getting ready to open.  Opportunities for small and larger businesses have started to open, from medium size commercial spaces to technically unrestored buildings that can be put together in &#8220;no time&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here are the best real estate and business opportunities in Casco Viejo right now!</p>
<p>Developer Hot Deal:</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G1s3EAAR">Water View Building:</a> full concrete structure, any developer or contractor with some experience that takes a look into this building will start jumping on one foot out of joy.  No demolition necessary (only for aesthetics), basically is a &#8220;plumbing, electricity, roof &amp; paint&#8221; job in order to get it ready to start producing some income.  Ideas for the building have included a young, budget 15 room hotel to 12 one bedroom rental apartments. Maybe an office building? the place can be anything, with very little investment. The best is that it has the ability to hit the middle market, which very few can. Nothing like a niche market to make a profit!</p>

<p>Restaurant Real Estate For Rent:</p>
<p>If you are not in a hurry and your concept needs more than 200 mt2, Casa Baluarte might be the right space for you.  Currently under construction, the project is divided into two spaces: <a title="corner restaurant" href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G1rudAAB">corner restaurant</a> and a <a title="Cafe Baluarte" href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G1ruiAAB">roof terrace café</a>. Both spaces will be delivered without finishes, so each tenant can create the necessary ambiance. <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Baluarte-Fasade-rendering.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5061" title="Baluarte Fasade rendering" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Baluarte-Fasade-rendering-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Baluarte-Fasade-rendering-300x170.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Baluarte-Fasade-rendering.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>You would like to open sooner? <a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000DPnX3AAL"> Casa Feraud </a>might be your space. It is a raw commercial space, but in a very visible corner. Renovation of the space is needed, so owners are willing to be flexible.

<p>&#8220;El Barón Rojo&#8221; (The Red Baron) is a small café at Calle 4ta and Avenida A, next to Arco Properties.   Brand new spot, so you won`t see the sign out yet! but you`ll see the chairs outside.  Their specialty: wonderful breakfasts which they serve starting at 7 a.m. and don´t stop until 3 p.m.</p>
<p>So far we`ve tried the granola with fruit and yogurt which is served in a very generous bowl and the pineapple juice was in one of those high 1 pint glasses you (well, not sure if &#8220;you&#8221; but any Panamanian) would link to carnival beer drinking. Loved it! give me that much of fresh pineapple juice anytime!</p>
<p>My next move will be to try the vegetarian big breakfast: two poached free-range eggs on grain toast, homemade hash browns, garlic mushrooms, tomato, spinach and avocado.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>This past weekend, the <a href="http://panama.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy</a>, <a href="http://www.fundacioncalicanto.org/">Fundacion Calicanto</a> and Casco Viejo developer <a href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/">Conservatorio S.A.</a> joined hands to build and paint a meeting space for Panama`s Scouts at the Santa Familia Community Center in San Felipe, Calle 4ta.</p>
<p>This meeting room will allow Troupe No. 3 Casco Viejo to develop its youth program, which has grown in the past two years from a small group of ten to thirty.  Some of the kids are starting to enter the &#8220;teenage&#8221; program, an important continuation that will provide a platform for at risk children, keeping them out of the streets during this difficult part of personal development. The troupe has been funded for years by members of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/AVACA-Asociaci%C3%B3n-de-Vecinos-y-Amigos-del-Casco-Antiguo/123332294355801">AVACA</a> (Casco Antiguo`s Friend`s and Neighbors Association) and had now grown to the point of needing a space to meet.</p>
<p>About 20 US Embassy volunteers painted side by side with a group over 40 Scouts and volunteers from Fundación Calicanto and private developer Conservatorio S.A. who helped set up the classroom. US Ambassador Phylis Powers had a wonderful time painting with the kids, and at the end a special &#8220;wall&#8221; was set up for everyone to &#8220;sign&#8221; it by marking it with their hands and writing their name next to it.</p>
<p>For over six years, Casco Viejo has been an interesting experimental ground for social programs, most of them founded by the private sector.  From successful educational programs for women and children to violence prevention and gang re socialization,  synergy among different NGO`s and the private sector has made true change through small but effective actions possible.  They provide with a sense of continuity that politic- driven changing governments can´t.  The US Embassy has also taken an important interest in supporting some of these programs as their contribution to prevent violence in the country.</p>
<p>For all of them, big thumbs up!</p>

Still undefined, but I would probably say is one packed with small unusual stuff, little happenings here and there that makes every day a &#8220;never a dull moment&#8221; life in this eclectic neighborhood.   From the absurd to the common, from people filming in the streets for an independent movie (dressed up as who knows what and just walking around) to kids playing &#8220;vintage&#8221; games like jumping on each other like frogs in the street (or should I say &#8220;forgotten games&#8221;?).</p>
<p>A neighborhood for the adventurous, artistic soul, Casco Viejo wakes up every day with something for everyone.</p>

<p>On Friday we attended the inauguration of Casa de Rosa, a restored building that used to belong to Rosa Eleta de Prieto back in 1921.  The apartments are quite spacious, specially the living rooms! </p>
<p>Records show that the original house was built in 1917.  However, when they started digging, they found a  piece of a &#8220;Hornabeque&#8221;.  An Hornabeque in Spanish is a defensive system that offshore colonial cities used to build back in 1765 &#8211; 1769.  This one was designed by Colonel Manuel Hernandez, who was sent to the Americas by King Charles III in 1759 to reinforce the security of the back then fortified Panama City. The piece of this wall is shown through a glass floor, and is a witness of a time where this area was nothing but flatland &#8230; and a wall. </p>
<p>The apartments are beautiful and will not be for sale&#8230; only for rent! While the area is in transition, you`ll be neighbors with the Danilo Perez jazz foundation and Olga Sinclair`s brand new art foundation. Last floor has great water views!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every city has stories hidden under their &#8220;cement jungle&#8221;.  This is the slogan for a History Channel TV Series called &#8220;Secret Histories&#8221;.   A couple of years ago they did an entire episode about Panama, which covers Casco Viejo with a lot of interesting characters.  The episode was made for Latin America, so it is all in Spanish. We`ve been trying to find out if they have it in English, but seems that they didn`t.</p>
<p>So, if you speak Spanish, take a look, it is a really well done show.  If you don`t,  we can still give you one great &#8220;secret&#8221; story to read about: did you know back during the Gold Rush it was a Texas Ranger who was called in to Panama to &#8220;put order&#8221; in town? Very much a &#8220;Billy the Kid&#8221;, you might find this little unknown piece of history quite interesting (and revealing) on how things where managed those days: <a title="Randolph Runnels" href="http://www.panamarailroad.org/runnels.html">Randolph Runnels. </a></p>

<p>You are a creative professional and so far had been working from home, or working for someone but trying to get more &#8220;space&#8221; for your own work.  Renting a shared office is not your style, mostly because you might not relate to the type of businesses next to you and synergy depends on having other creative people around that are on the same (or similar!) wavelength.</p>
<p>Before you go crazy at home (or at work) consider CascoStation!  It is not a &#8220;shared office&#8221; nor a &#8220;virtual office&#8221;.  Is a group of independent creative professionals (artists, web, digital, etc) that use CascoStation temporarily to share, network, meet with clients, develop projects.</p>
<p>Located at Calle 5ta &amp; A Avenue, Casco Viejo, fees depend on how much you are there: you can come daily, or just a couple of days or only on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Check out more info and great photos of the facility inside here: <a title="Photos" href="http://cascostation.com/pages/fotos">COWORKING</a></p>
<p>Or write Harold (he is fully bilingual, but somehow the website seems to be only in Spanish): work@CascoStation.com</p>
<p>They are also on Facebook and Twitter: Casco Station</p>

<p>Los Del Patio is a small art center in Casco Viejo that provides classes for local children as well as adults. They also have art shows, theater plays and even a small café. Little by little, they`ve been putting together all the tools they need for their work, however they are still missing some stuff and would like to let everyone know in case you happen to have one at home or just want to donate.</p>
<p>Here it is! Los Del Patio Wishlist: it goes from an a/c unit and 40 chairs for their classroom, to art supplies (brush, paint, cardboard, etc.).  You can contact YIYI at their <a title="Yiyi" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Los-Del-Patio/106707806033504">FACEBOOK </a>page.  Or email Arco Properties and we`ll put you in touch: patrizia@arcoproperties.com</p>

<p>I have to say I`m very happy with the guys of Top Level Gym.  They opened a couple of months ago and its been fabulous.  I`ve developed muscles I never thought I would and my cardio has gotten quite better.  It is fun, and their crossfit only takes 20 minutes on their top case scenario.  You can always go and do some boxing or wrestling (they do Jiu Jitsu), but for me crossfit and yoga are the best.</p>
<p>Here is their schedule. If you live or work in Casco Viejo and dreamed about getting fit&#8230; this is it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo Panama</p>
<p>The name of Bruce Quinn in Panama is synonym of &#8220;theatre&#8221; and &#8220;musicals&#8221;. Since I can recall, Bruce has been an unstoppable dynamo, year after year bringing us beautiful productions, anything from Chicago to Annie and even plays by local writers and singers.</p>
<p>A &#8220;Zonian&#8221;  Bruce was born into Panama`s Canal Zone in the 40`s,  which back in the day meant you had double nationality: Panamanian and American. In the 60`s he starts producing theater shows and more than 200 plays later, he is still running up and down the stage,  guiding young talents, encouraging to give their best.  Several generations have passed by his &#8220;school&#8221; and are now well known professionals in Panama`s young theater and TV scene.  A beloved grandfather to the genre itself in this country and an example to follow.</p>
<p>A Casconian for many years, Bruce himself is a living history treaty full of juicy facts that I`m sure are a constant inspiration for his work. Last night, the homage at the Canal Museum was set up in three Acts: the formal one where he received as a gift from the Canal Museum a historic tile of the building, then the museum exhibition (which will be open to the public for a month, until the 15th of September) and the &#8220;Show of all Shows&#8221; where Bruce himself delighted his friends by acting and singing!</p>
<p>So much can be said about him and his experiences that could fill several books. For sure, only a selection of his work filled up a museum floor&#8230; and let me tell you, to see all his plays lined up was simply impressive.  What an achievement! Congratulations Bruce!</p>

<p>Looking for historic material to write this blog, I found this really<a title="Boston" href="http://ia600308.us.archive.org/17/items/oldpanamacastill00andeuoft/oldpanamacastill00andeuoft.pdf"> cool book</a> (from 1911) with all the gossip about America`s Discovery, founding of the Old Panama City and its later destruction by pirate Henry Morgan, which led to the founding of Casco Viejo, our beloved neighborhood.</p>
<p>So, in celebration of Panama`s &#8220;roots&#8221; here are photos of the city that became one of the most important links during Europe`s conquest of the Americas!</p>
<p>A small poem found on page 23:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here the oceans twain have waited</p>
<p>All the ages to be maited, &#8211;</p>
<p>waited long, and waited vainly,</p>
<p>Though the script was written plainly;</p>
<p>This, the portal of the sea,</p>
<p>Opens for him who holds the key;</p>
<p>Here the empire of the earth</p>
<p>Waits in patience for its birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Jeffrey Roche</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Panama!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Panamá La Vieja or Old Panama was the first European settlement at the Pacific Ocean. Founded August 15th, 1519 it will be blowing its 492 th candle on Monday!</p>
<p>&#8220;Panama City&#8221; back then was called &#8220;Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Panamá&#8221;&#8230;. ok, not precisely a 140-character-Twitter-like-easy-to-remember-name, so not surprisingly it got shortened to just &#8220;Panama&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shortly after founded, it became the main link for the conquest of Peru.  It grew rich but also had zillion problems such as big fires, health issues (tons of mosquitoes, as they settled in a swampy area&#8230;. well, nothing was known yet about what caused all those &#8220;tropical fevers&#8221;).   The place was also a nightmare to defend, as the bay was easily approachable, a lesson they learned painfully through having to defend the city of several pirate attacks.  And when in 1671 got sacked by Pirate Henry Morgan (it is said that the booty was carried in 195 mules!)  the inhabitants of the city decided they had enough&#8230; and moved to Casco Viejo.</p>

<p>Holidays in Cuba evoque sun, guayaberas, music, mojitos and dance. An image of the famous Hotel   Nacional, Cuba’s most recognized hotel mixes with glimpses of Havana Vieja and white beaches at Varadero. But few know that Panama and Cuba were sister countries from the beginning, as they were founded almost at the same time: <a title="Panama viejo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Panama">Panamá Viejo</a> in August (1519) and <a title="Havana Cuba" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana">Habana Vieja</a> in November (1519).  And few realize how easy it is to invest in Panama&#8230; Cuban Style.</p>
<p>How and why?  first a bit of history since this upcoming Monday the 15th, we celebrate the foundation of Panama Viejo (or Panama La Vieja).  This city which was Spain’s first settlement at the Pacific, was moved after its destruction by Pirate Henry Morgan to Casco Viejo (called interchangeably San Felipe or Casco Antiguo) where gold from South America was sent to Europe by mule through Panama’s dense jungle, then by boat to the mythical Portobelo and from there to Cuba.  Through years of this exchange, Panama and Cuba grew very much alike culturally and architecturally.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4812" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-Panama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4812" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-Panama-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="191" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-Panama-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-Panama.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Casco Viejo Panama </figcaption></figure>
<p>When walking around, visitors are often surprised at how much it reminds them of Havana, Cuba.  Children playing everywhere, street music on Fridays (and frankly, all weekend).  Caribbean architecture mixed with Spanish Colonial, French and even Art Deco, reflecting Panama’s cultural makeup in a cozy human scale.  Today, Casco Viejo &#8211; one of the most eclectic historic real estate in the region &#8211; is being revitalized, hosting the best <a title="Arco Recommends" href="http://arcoproperties.com/casco-life/arco-recommends/">restaurants, hotels, bars and theatres </a>of Panama City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-nightlife.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4813" title="Casco Viejo nightlife" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-nightlife-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-nightlife-300x200.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-nightlife.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>While owning a piece of Havana might be a challenge, real estate in Casco Viejo  is privately owned, easy to purchase and fully titled. It is already home to a  mixed community of locals and foreigners from all around the globe (Europeans, Americans&#8230; Australians!).  With hotels already under construction targeted to different economic niches, the area is about to experience a wave of appreciation. Prices for fully restored properties are half of their renovated peers in Cartagena or San Juan, where they have already felt the benefits of hotels and tourism.</p>
<p>Panama has already positioned itself as the hub of the Americas, with easy connections to the United States, Europe and South America. If you are reading this and might think on checking it out, clear a long weekend and experience it first hand!</p>

<p>It used to be the flag ship store of the Benedetti Hermanos back in 1928.  The original commercial space at the ground floor had an elegant glass facade that echoed the look and feel of Madison Avenue shops of the day.   In the 50`s it was a well known furniture store, the perfect business to take advantage of such commanding street presence.</p>

<p>A group of photographers sneaked into the night and took over Las Bovedas. Armed with amazing cameras and tripods, they took photos of everything and anything that passed by, including me and my dog. While I`m sure we ended up as a &#8220;study case&#8221; at someone`s studio with the generic name &#8220;girl n`dog&#8221; (which could have been taken anywhere), most of the photos where of Las Bovedas itself and the ocean, true tourism &#8220;postcards&#8221; for Panama and the old city. To imagine the thousands of photos of Casco Viejo that must be flying right now around the world through all these professionals!</p>

<p>A client came into our office yesterday and marveled at the thriving activity in Casco Viejo.  He pointed out that there are almost no streets in San Felipe that doesn`t have something going on, whether a new business opening or a property under construction.   Plaza Herrera, one of the biggest and most beautiful plazas which was abandoned up until now, is a vibrant &#8220;under construction&#8221; site.  Located at the center of Casco Antiguo is is destined to become its commercial heart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Panama has slowly gotten into the &#8220;organic&#8221; wave.  Little by little, small farms are getting their connections and productions worked out and they`re reaching Casco Viejo!</p>
<p>This past month, I`ve been keeping an eye out for good products and services.  Here are my favorites!</p>
<p><a title="Culantro y yo" href="http://www.culantrorojo.com/blog/"></p>
<figure id="attachment_4724" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-organic.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-4724" title="Casco Viejo organic" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casco-Viejo-organic-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Culantro Rojo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Culantro Rojo:</a> Season vegetables, goat cheese, cacao, borojo juice, marmalade of strange tropical fruits I can`t pronounce but taste great, honey, home made pesto, organic dry beans, organic eggs, goat cheese (wonderful! yummi&#8230; ), goat yogurts, organic Duck and even home made soaps.</p>
<p>Once a week they send an email reminding you what they have in store.  They can deliver to your home or you can pick it up at their office in Calle 4ta, Casco Viejo. They are between Arco Properties and Central Avenue.  Contact them at: info@culantrorojo.com</p>
<p><a title="Super Gourmet" href="http://www.supergourmetcascoviejo.com/">Super Gourmet</a>: Casco`s favorite lunch hangout, they have the basic vegetables (tomatoes, onions, avocado, seasonal fruits), Soy Milk and organic cacao.    They also carry a complete line of coconut oil based beauty products that come from the Caribbean province of Bocas del Toro.  Try the coconut oil with ginger! soaps and more. Location: A Avenue and 6th Street.</p>
<p><a title="Papiro y Yo" href="http://www.papiroyyo.com/">Papiro y Yo</a>:   our favorite store for gifts made out of paper and recycling materials have started to take their good &#8220;taste&#8221; to another level.  Creative new souvenirs involving organic products. The true meaning of &#8220;Made in Panama&#8221;!.  They are carrying organic honey, black pepper and other spices.  Rosemary soaps, Cinnamon soaps and other beautiful scents.  Location: 4th Street, between Ave. Central and B Avenue. Some of their products have been started to be carried by restaurants such as Caffe Vienna (1st Street and A Avenue).</p>
<p><a title="New Earth Panama" href="http://www.newearthpanama.com/">New Earth Panama</a>: I tried their delivery service this weekend and it was really good.  They don´t base in Casco Viejo (yet!).   They have a wide selection of products, including not only fruit, vegetables and grains, but also  fish, seafood and eggs.  I placed an order Sunday at noon through the website, and they confirmed it by phone shortly after. It showed up at my office Monday morning, featuring a BIG papaya that I thought was going to take half of my fridge (didn`t I ask for the &#8220;medium&#8221; size one? &#8230; yes you did&#8230; this is it&#8230;.was the answer).  Loved it!</p>
<p>Here is the contact:  José David Nieto  Cel.: (507)67319805/ jdn@newearthpanama.com / info@newearthpanama.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>One of the things I enjoy the most in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://arcoproperties.com/casco-life/">Casco Viejo</a> is the fact that each home is truly different from the one next to it. There are no identical twins here, no &#8220;copy &#8211; paste&#8221; and each one has a history of its own.</p>
<p><a title="Casa Vidal" href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a0030000009pkdoAAA">Casa Vidal </a> , our featured home for sale, is the perfect example. The first public deed of the house dates from August 12th, 1899 and certifies that the owner was Doña Teresa Arosemena de Vidal, known as the Widow Vidal.  Back then, Panama was not even Panama, but the &#8220;isthmus&#8221; of Panama and it belonged to Colombia!</p>
<p>Today, Casa Vidal has been developed into one of the few Casco Viejo`s single family townhouse.  The contrast between the house`s Caribbean style upper facade with the heavier groundfloor made out of colonial stone and carved in a French style illustrates the architectural eclecticism for which Casco Antiguo is known.</p>
<p>Abandoned for nearly half a century, Casa Vidal`s stone and mortar ground floor stood strong, but her wooden fasade and structure needed to be completely rebuilt. This provided the design team with the opportunity to take advantage of the interior`s great volumes and natural light.  The double height living room brings a special feeling to the main area, while the thickness of the walls bring a cozy, intimate feeling to the house.</p>
<p>The master bedroom allows privacy, light and cross ventilation. Casa Vidal`s ground floor opens onto a walled garden, providing the opportunity for a private den, office or guest bedroom.</p>
<p>But without a doubt, Casa Vidal`s most unusual features is the rooftop deck with its plunge pool and stunning views of Panama City, the Pacific Ocean and the Paseo Esteban Huertas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Price: $860,000</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Area: 376.16 mt2</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3 Bedrooms, 3 1/2 Bathrooms</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Under Construction)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>Lunch with Panamanian Grammy Award winner Danilo Pérez is an experience on its own.  He is full of energy and information, but most of it all, I always end up loving Panama a bit more after talking to him.  I didn`t know, for example, that Panama was one of the countries that had more &#8220;musicians per capita&#8221; contributing significantly to jazz.  At every Panama Jazz Festival, he makes a point of dedicating each to a different musician and to celebrate their life and contribution.</p>
<p>This year, the 9th edition of the <a title="Panama Jazz Festival " href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/english/">Panama Jazz Festival</a> will be dedicated to <a title="Carlos Garnett" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttl1Y61dyig&amp;feature=watch_response">Carlos Garnett,</a> a self taught saxophonist who started playing calypso music back in 1957.  He moves to New York in the 60`s and ends up playing with big names such as Mile Davis and Charles Mingus.</p>
<p>2012 Panama Jazz Festival will be exciting! Big names like Tito Puente Jr and Omara Portuondo will be here. Chucho Valdés, Charlie Sepulveda, Luis Bonilla,  John Scofield, Marlow Rosado, Teri Roigers, all of them sharing stage from January 16th to the 21st, 2012.</p>
<p>We don´t have the specific schedule yet, so keep tuned!</p>

<p>Everybody excited and dressed up, the National Theatre was buzzing last night.  The performance opened with Panama`s National Orchestra.  The second part blew people away with Alexander Panizza`s impecable technique.  His encore: La Campanella. Standing ovation!</p>
<p>After such a fantastic performance, we went straight to <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas,</a> I had a craving for their &#8220;guacho de mariscos&#8221; which is a very nice risotto with tomato and seafood sauce.  Lime and home made picante for those who like it spicy! for me, tons of lime!</p>
<p>Out of the blue, Carlos, the manager of the restaurant, sat down at the restaurant`s piano and started playing beautifully! I think his favorite is Schumann, he really played it with a heart!</p>
<p>Small and big surprises&#8230; nowhere else but in Casco Viejo!</p>

<p>Yesterday I was running to Las Clementinas in Casco Viejo to meet a client. So I was walking &#8220;full speed ahead&#8221;, but as rushed as I was I used two micro seconds to take this photo: a girl modeling with her white dress in the middle of Plaza Catedral.</p>
<p>It makes me smile how people come to Casco Viejo because they want it immortalized in their most special photos.  I`ve seen wedding photos, sweet sixteen photos (in Panama is sweet fifteen), and of course there is always the &#8220;fashion&#8221; category as most magazines in Panama shoot in Casco Viejo quite often.  Not to mention the day to day visitor with their families and their dogs.</p>
<p>I guess the photos speak for themselves! Casco Viejo has plenty of romantic and interesting scenarios and beautiful landscapes!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Argentinian pianist <a title="Alexander Panizza" href="http://www.alexanderpanizza.com.ar/biografia.php?idioma=en">Alexander Panizza,</a> who is recognized internationally because of its impeccable classical repertoire,  will be performing this week at Casco Viejo`s National Theatre.  Wednesday 27th, at 8 p.m. , all proceeds will go to the Danilo Perez Foundation.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the <a title="Danilo Perez Foundation" href="http://www.fundaciondaniloperez.org/daniloperez.html">Danilo Perez Foundation</a>, they founded Panama`s first Jazz School which is located in Plaza Herrera, Casco Viejo.  Their dream, which today is a reality, was to reach out to the poorest neighborhoods and open their eyes to another world full of possibilities through music.</p>
<p>They started small, the first big obstacle was to find a place.  A private developer commited to a <a title="revitalization" href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=100&amp;Itemid=82">holistic revitalization </a>of Casco Viejo (<a title="Conservatorio S.A. " href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/">Conservatorio S.A.</a>) donated part of what used to be the old Music Conservatory to the school.  There, the Foundation started to teach children from Chorrillo, Santa Ana, San Felipe and even as far as Colón.</p>
<p>International jazz star <a title="Danilo Perez" href="http://www.daniloperez.com/">Danilo Perez </a>and his wife, musician and &#8220;chief in command&#8221; Patricia Zarate, are the dynamos behind the foundation .  They created what today is one of the best jazz festivals in the region: the Panama Jazz Festival.  Through the festival, their dream was to raise the bar in music education in Panama (Danilo is Panamanian) and after several years they are starting to see the results. Today, their best &#8220;kids&#8221; play in Boston with the <a title="Berklee" href="http://www.berklee.edu/focused/global-jazz/">Berklee Global Jazz  Institute</a>. And this year, for the first time, one of their students will  complete the cycle which started when he was 13 years old: he is moving from being a <a title="Fellowship" href="http://www.fundaciondaniloperez.org/scholarship_winners.html">student</a> and a performer to a teacher.   In the  years to come, their first full graduation will be doing the same, coming back to Panamá to help others like them break the cycle of poverty through first class music education.</p>
<p>Thumbs up to the Danilo Perez Foundation and everyone supporting their amazing work!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>This is going to be lots of fun! whenever you put together a group like Jonathan Harper, Brooke Alfaro, Yiyi Ibarra and Sandra Eleta it has to be fun. Their work is really good, and they`ll be joined by other recognized figures in Panama`s art scene such as Cisco Merel, Dona Conlon, Ana Elena Garuz, Isabel de Obaldía, Alicia Viteri, Emily Zhukov and Federico Herrero.</p>
<p>The idea: an art raffle!</p>
<p>How does it work: they`ll be selling tickets at $500 each. Only ten tickets will be sold, and you`ll be able to exchange the ticket for a piece of art.  What will be raffled is the order in which you`ll be able to choose.</p>
<p>All the proceeds will be donated to improve Los Del Patio art space. They provide with art classes and a lot more. Read a bit more about them and the event in the invitation below. Click the photo to enlarge. See you there!</p>
<p>Where: Los Del Patio, Calle 3era and Central Avenue</p>
<p>When: July 28th, 2011 / 7:30 p.m.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>In the last few months, a battle of ideas have been taking place in Panama, concerning Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>For more than a year, the government has been exploring options to connect Panama City (modern side) to future private developments in Amador.  Because in the middle is <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://arcoproperties.com/casco-life/casco-history/">Casco Viejo,</a> our beautiful 300 year old UNESCO World Heritage Site, the method of connecting was said to be a tunnel that would go under 17th Street, which is outside the historic district.</p>
<p>After a public bidding was awarded for the tunnel, the government announced that they preferred to do a landfill around Casco Viejo.  While this option would add much needed parking and probably on the short term add value to the real estate in the historic district, the community is standing up because it would risk the World Heritage designation for both Casco Viejo and Panama Viejo, two important pieces of Panamanian identity, not to mention two of the three most visited touristic sites.  Tourism is today, Panama`s most important economic engine.</p>
<p>For the last two months, the battle of ideas on how to connect A to B has been going on.  On October 2010, UNESCO declared the landfill &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;. In July 2011 the government of Panama traveled to the 35th UNESCO World Heritage meeting and committed to stop the project until studies were shown to UNESCO and reviewed by experts. At home, however, they continue to lobby the road (and even a marine bridge) as ways to connect.  Civil Society defending Patrimony (which now sums to more than 15 organizations and an unheard group for Panama standards of more than 16,000 people in Facebook) has also made proposals that wouldn`t involve Casco Viejo and save funding to invest in social urbanism by connecting through a back road known as Avenida de los Martires. UNESCO will review the government studies in December 2011  and will have an official opinion by then.</p>
<p>But what does all of this mean to someone investing or considering to invest in Casco Viejo?  While as realtors we can tell you that probably the landfill will help values in the district because of access to parking,  as part of this community our position is that we believe there is a higher value on the long term wealth provided by being a World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>We don´t have a crystal ball (yet!) to be certain on how this issue will be resolved. However, we tend to look at Casco Viejo holistically and our business as long  term.  For us, (strangely enough to be said by realtors) this  isn`t about money. This is about the authenticity of a historic district  and the permanent, sustainable growth that well managed UNESCO World  Heritage Sites create.   Casco Viejo is a perfect example of how to  create sustainable wealth through identity, and thus, we actively  support options that would allow to keep the World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>The national front that has been formed to lobby for options that won`t affect patrimony has joined under a slogan: <a href="http://www.orgullo.com.pa/">Proud of Panama.</a> And proud we are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>From time to time we like to publish a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of what is available and comment. These past months rentals have been quite active,  with leases being renewed,  new leases being signed and apartments coming to market.</p>
<p>One of the frequently asked questions is whether is better to rent furnished or unfurnished.  In Casco Viejo, we never have a hundred options of each. They come and go in waves. Sometimes we won`t have a single unit furnished, and others is all we have.  The key is knowing what you absolutely need, because once you decide you need a two bedroom, or three (and parking) the group of available properties most likely reduces to&#8230;. one&#8230; or maybe two!</p>
<p>Right now, and not for long, we have a wide range of properties available. Let`s order them according to the number of bedrooms:</p>
<p>One Bedrooms: $700 &#8211; $1500</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Castilla-de-Oro-Fasade.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4522" title="Castilla de Oro Fasade" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Castilla-de-Oro-Fasade-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="97" height="100" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Castilla-de-Oro-Fasade-290x300.jpg 290w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Castilla-de-Oro-Fasade.jpg 325w" sizes="(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px" /></a>Castilla de Oro: $700/ 60 mt2 (partially furnished). Groundfloor unit, ideal for a single person. The building has excellent location and great neighbors. It also has 24 hour security and is pet friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0454.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4540" title="IMG_0454" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0454-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Casa Morales: $700 / 50 mt2 (unfurnished):  Small studio with direct water views.  One single space, nice for a bohemian soul. Great location, you can join the basketball or football games at the field right in front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casco-Viejo-Panama-Bedroom.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4523" title="Casco Viejo Panama Bedroom" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casco-Viejo-Panama-Bedroom-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000FB1ZWAA1">Marques de Portago: </a>$800/ 60 mt2. Furnished, groundfloor.  This is a small unit for a single person, it is probably the lowest price in our current list. Marques is one of the first restorations in Casco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4381.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4524" title="IMG_4381" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4381-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000CrBdEAAV">Star and Herald Studio:</a> $1000 / $50 mt2.  Modern feeling, clean style. Groundfloor. This is a classic artist- type unit where the unit has no space divisions. We like the street as it tends to be very quiet, but yet steps away from Plaza Catedral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4397.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4525" title="IMG_4397" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4397-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G1RccAAF">Star and Herald No. 9</a>= $1400 / 88 mt2 and parking. Located on the first floor, has a balcony with views and parking. Quite convenient!it is a one bedroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_3980.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4526" title="IMG_3980" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_3980-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000ColU7AAJ">Plaza Catedral: $1300</a>./110 mt2 Loft style one bedroom. This unit has the advantage of being at the plaza but not on the plaza.  Plazas are great places if you like a more lively scene. There are always restaurants, people, concerts (great jazz festival in January!), but if you are more of a private person, then this unit is for you, because it is located at the side of the building. So you still have the view of the plaza, but not the &#8220;wildness&#8221; factor, if you want to call it that way.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_5535.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4527" title="IMG_5535" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_5535-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G0U9KAAV">Casa Zarak: $1500 / 88 mt2 &#8211; $2500/</a> 91 mt2 to $110.  Casa Zarak is the only water front building that is all available for rent. You can`t purchase here.  At this point, the building, which has been under construction for a year and a half, is getting its final touches.  First tenants should be ready to move in by August, although take notice that in Panama there is always an &#8220;ish&#8221; to these dates.  Most units are one bedrooms, but there are a few two bedrooms too. All units have direct water views. They are unfurnished.</p>
<p>Two Bedrooms:</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_3570.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4528" title="IMG_3570" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_3570-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Casa Burson: $1500/74 mt2 (unfurnished).  Wood floors and a wrap around balcony, Casa Burson has a nice café on its groundfloor and  is steps away from Las Clementinas excellent Sunday brunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4907.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4529" title="IMG_4907" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4907-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G17vhAAB">Parque Bolívar: $1500</a> (furnished) or $1200 (unfurnished).  Direct plaza views, upper floor.  Wood floors, great balcony. This was one of the first buildings to be restored in Casco, so it has a cozy tropical ambiance.  Located at Plaza Bolívar, you`ll have a wide range of Panama`s best restaurants and cevicherías at your feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Living-Room.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4530" title="Living-Room" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Living-Room-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000CSNWDAA5">Santo Domingo: $2000/</a> 120 mt2 (furnished).  Wonderful location, and has parking! This is a quiet unit, very private.  Steps away from the National Theatre and the Tourism Police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casco-Viejo-roof-terrace.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4542" title="Casco Viejo roof terrace" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casco-Viejo-roof-terrace-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G1UaBAAV">Casa Malecon: $2100/</a> 189 mt2 (unfurnished). This unit might have the best views of Casco Viejo. Located in Terraplen, it has direct water views to the front, direct views to Panama`s skyline to the left and beautiful Casco Viejo to the right.  Terraplen is considered to be an area in transition. One of the interesting features is that it is steps away from Panama`s Fish Market and its delicious Peruvian restaurant (at the top floor). Ask for a jar of Pisco Sour and order the &#8220;jalea&#8221;! Panama is all about undiscovered pleasures.</p>
<p>Three Bedrooms:</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4844.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4531" title="IMG_4844" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4844-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000G1MGoAAN">Plaza Catedral Upper Floor</a>: $3500/126 mt2. This is one of the few three  bedrooms in town and is on the plaza. Beautiful balcony, direct views,  corner location.  The building doesn`t have elevator, so please take  notice this unit is on the third floor. It comes completely furnished,  and is available for short term rent at $1500 per week. This is the  ultimate balcony you want to be at during Jazz Fest! As a matter of  fact, if you rent this unit through Arco, the deal is that you have to  keep a spot for us during the festival!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casuale.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4532" title="Casuale" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casuale-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/properties/show/a008000000CT2S6AAL">University Club: $2100 </a>/ 150 mt2 (unfurnished).  Excellent location in Calle 1era, steps away from landmarks such as Las Bovedas and the French Embassy.  Very good unit for families.</p>

<p>Last night, the French community in Panama gathered at Casco Viejo, around the historic &#8220;Plaza Francia&#8221; (or French Plaza) to celebrate La Bastille Day.  Plaza Francia is one of Casco Viejo`s best known icons, built in honor of the French who initiated the construction of the Panama Canal.   Today, Casco Viejo is home to a growing number of French neighbors, from the regional director to Channel, to developers and journalists.</p>
<p>Fireworks closed the evening. People strolled by <a title="Las Bovedas" href="http://arcoproperties.com/casco-life/virtual-tours/las-bovedas/">Las Bovedas,</a> enjoying the tropical breeze and peaceful marine landscape.  This morning, when we went for our walk, sunlight was bathing the &#8220;rooster&#8221; monument and the flags made for beautiful photos!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>We are proud to present our new <a title="ARco Properties" href="http://arcoproperties.com/">Arco Properties</a> website.  Exploring our listings in Casco Viejo will be easier with tools such as Google Maps and easy icons letting you know about amenities for each one.  Casco Life has all the bits and pieces about day to day life in Casco Viejo, from an updated list of restaurants, galleries and hotels, to schools nearby and how much they cost.</p>
<p>One thing we learned through this process is that there is no specific point where you can say &#8220;it is 100% finished, done&#8221;.  This will be an ongoing project!</p>
<p>One of my favorite new features is the episode where we appeared at House Hunters International.  If you haven`t seen it, check it out at <a title="How to Buy in Casco Viejo" href="http://arcoproperties.com/casco-property/how-to-buy-in-casco/">HOW TO BUY</a>.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing trouble (the old website keeps coming up) you might want to clear up your &#8220;cache&#8221;.  Here is how it`s done: <a title="clearing cache " href="http://www.bnl.gov/itd/webapps/browsercache.asp">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Casco Viejo</p>
<p>Last Friday we went to one of Diablo Rosso`s art shows in <a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a>, which was named using the game of words Diablo (Devil in Spanish):  &#8220;A Friend of the Devil is a Friend of Mine&#8221;.  The show featured several young artists with some playful pieces and of course the really bizarre ones.  Whether is a movie night (Cena Cine) or one of their shows, it is always great to pass by and be surrounded by young, creative souls.  In Spanish we have a saying &#8220;God makes them, the Devil puts them together&#8221;!  In Diablo Rosso, this might be particularly true!</p>

<p>Yesterday was supposed to be the eclipse of the century. Obviously, being in Panama, not exactly a full eclipse. But people did get eclipse fever! The day was simply gorgeous, the light was golden and people were happily walking from here to there doing silly things!  For example, just stepping out of Arco, we found this trying to prevent illegal parking:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12177" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_9418-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>But then we thought a better job was bike riding:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12179" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_9430-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>But he said he always wanted to drive a truck. Good think we found one his size!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12180" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_9432-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />  he was so happy!  but after a while he fell asleep</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12182" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_9434-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12181" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_9433-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>I think he was still there this morning. Workers were very puzzled!</p>

<p>We´ve been writing about Santa Ana for the last two years, as the revitalization of Casco Antiguo advances. Recently, the Municipality Office has taken the initiative in this area and they have started to execute a macro infrastructure project.  They started transforming the historic Sal si Puedes alley, and in the last few months they fenced and starting to renovate the plaza itself and re do the piping along Central Avenue. Walking around right now is a mess, but what an exciting mess!</p>

<p>Last Friday we went out with some friends to the newly opened (beautiful and with great stuff!) Stranger´s Club. From there we went to the also newly opened El Social, a beer garden just next door. By the time we were finished there we were hungry again. This would have normally be a problem in Casco, but not anymore! Amici Miei to the rescue. Really nice pizza, pasta and salads, they are open until late and located exactly at the right spot: next to La Concordia hotel, on Ave Central and 11th street (by the traffic light). We ordered a personal pizza ($3.50!) with arugula. And the margheritta was exactly what I needed at that hour. They are open for lunch too.</p>

<p>Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama`s Historic District</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>US former President Bill Clinton was seen this past week roaming the streets of <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a>, Panama`s 300 year old colonial city. Under the Panamanian tropical sun, and wearing a &#8220;Panama Hat&#8221;, orange polo shirt and kaki pants, Clinton enjoyed restaurants and bought handcrafts. He came to Panama to give a conference called &#8220;Embracing our common humanity&#8221; and during his brief time in our country he visited two sites: the Panama Canal and Casco Antiguo.</p>
<p>Doesn`t that says it all?</p>
<p>Casco Antiguo has become one of the leading <a title="about casco viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">tourism attractions of Panama</a>. The second most visited site in Panama City, it stands between the main brands Panama has to offer to compete at an international level for tourism.  The first one being the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>During his speech, Clinton highlighted how today`s world faces tremendous challenges towards the environment, reduction of poverty and economic revitalization.  In Casco Antiguo, an interesting model has been developed in the  last five years where the private sector has invested heavily in social programs at the same time that it has developed the local architecture.  As a result, the historic city has become one of the safest parts of town and has positioned itself not only as the second tourism destination of Panama City but also as Panama`s cultural axis.</p>
<p>While there is still much left to be done,  and much of the work might not become apparent to the visitor (that didn´t know the area before)  the Casco has started to become an example for other communities within Panama and even small towns in countries such as Colombia.</p>
<p>For now, we are just happy Mr. Clinton passed by and enjoyed our neighborhood and hope he twitters a lot of friends about his visit!</p>

<p>Real Estate at Casco Viejo, Panama</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New hotel opening doors in Casco Viejo!   Casa del Horno is an Italian owned/run eight suite hotel that takes its name after the historic calicanto stone oven that is located in the building.  Dating from 1886 (or maybe before?) the building has a lot of that charming stone walls and arches feeling that we all love of colonial cities.</p>
<p>Each suite is really like a one or two bedroom apartment. Their pricing goes from $250 to $350 per night.  The restaurant downstairs is still on the works, but hopefully will open in the next few months.  Great wine selection, as the owners are also the owners of the well known Di Vino Enoteca at 5th Street.</p>
<p>Lovely work guys! congratulations!</p>
<p>For more information, contact ph. (507) 212.0052 or <a href="mailto:info@casadelhorno.net">info@casadelhorno.net</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a week! I`ve been running around like crazy. But somehow, in the middle of the hurricane, I came across this couple who was taking photos for their wedding. An entire entourage around them between photographers and friends (taking care of the dress). <a title="virtual tours casco viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#Maps_and_Virtual_Tours"> Casco Viejo</a> seems to be irresistible for romance. The beautiful marine landscape, the breeze, the park, the birds and children playing. No noise from traffic, no smog, somehow the city manages to fade out and people can unwind and smile.</p>

<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>Walking the streets of <a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a> you wouldn´t suspect there is a Freemasonry Lodge in town. The fraternity was founded in Panama in 1821. However, the building we went last night was built in 1925 at what used to be the limits of the Casco Viejo: 13th Street.  I guess back then trying to get farther away would take you into the jungle! Today, you can just walk a couple of minutes and you`ll be there.</p>
<p>A beautiful building and in excellent shape, they opened their doors last night for a small art show depicting their classic masonry symbols.</p>
<p>Intrigued by their history, I found they have an official website where they list briefly how their members had important participation in events such as Panama`s independence and companies such as the Star and Herald newspaper (back then published in French).  Back in 1821 they were called &#8220;La Mejor Union&#8221; (The Best Union).   It is said that some of Panama`s presidents have been members,  a favorite argument for those who like conspiracy theories!</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about them, here is their <a title="Logia Panama" href="http://www.granlogiadepanama.org/historia/historia/">website</a> (written in Spanish).  They also have a Women`s Mason <a title="women`s mason" href="http://masfempanama.blogspot.com/">website here</a>.</p>

Yesterday, they inaugurated an exhibition about one of the best known Panamanian musicians of the early Republic:  Narciso Garay.</p>
<p>Born in 1876 (died in 1953) he was the son of a poet and a painter. Almost inevitably, he becomes a violinist. After his studies in Brussels and Paris he returns to Panama. He is known during his professional life as a teacher and an important diplomat,  representing Panama throughout the world.   Unsurprisingly, there is very little written in the internet about him, although I could find in Wikipedia a good page about his sister (<a title="Nicole Garay" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolle_Garay">Nicolle Garay</a>) who became a well known poet.</p>
<p>Today, Casco Viejo remembers him in one of its buildings which was said to be his house.  Every day there is a story to be uncovered in this 300 year old neighborhood!</p>

<p>Sweating, panting, red like a tomato &#8230; and with a big smile!  <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo`s</a> first gym started and already we have enthusiasts hitting the bag like there is no tomorrow. Stephen Crissman, the trainer, gives instructions and pushes you to do things better. Additional to boxing,  he trains in Jiu-Jitsu and there is another trainer for Muay Thai.  If you are not into artistic and lethal martial arts, you can try their cross fit, which makes honor to their slogan &#8220;work hard, live well&#8221;!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home#Home">Casco Viejo Real Estate Blog</a></p>
<p>Having a 400 mt2 home in a historic city (any historic city) is quite a unique thing. Those are truly special opportunities,  each one is irreplaceable.  At this time you will be able to find in  Casco Viejo two properties under this parameter:  Casa Vidal and Benedetti Penthouse Central.</p>
<p>Very different from each other, they share certain features such as water views, access to a pool and the ability to have three bedrooms.  But they are diametrically opposed in style and form, one being more of a colonial townhouse and the other, a penthouse so unique it is said to be among the finest in Panama City.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/best-views-vidal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3508" title="Best Views Vidal" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/best-views-vidal.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="146" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/best-views-vidal.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/best-views-vidal-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>$860,000 Casa Vidal Townhouse:  At the best address in town: 1st street, a few steps from the well known French Embassy and French Plaza.  The house runs on four levels, with double height ceilings and a roof terrace  with a nice bar and pool area from where you can enjoy views to Panama City and the bay.  It is a very private home, where you can have an office or use the groundfloor as a guest bedroom.  Why we personally like it? of course there is the pool and the views, but  it is perfect for pet owners since it has a patio at the ground level and no neighbors to discuss whether you are allowed or not up to a 25 pound dog.   Casa Vidal also gives you a feeling of privacy and coziness, which we very much enjoy.</p>
<p>The house is being sold without finishes, which means the owner is free to create whichever style is closest to his or her heart.  The property features original colonial walls, which are amazing for both modern or more classical interior designs.</p>

<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/casco-viejo-living-room-spacious.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3509" title="Casco Viejo living room spacious" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/casco-viejo-living-room-spacious.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/casco-viejo-living-room-spacious.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/casco-viejo-living-room-spacious-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>$1,250,000 Benedetti Penthouse C:  One of Panama`s most beautiful penthouses,  not only because of its fine design and finishes but also because of its stunning views.  The building has one of the few social areas with gardens and swimming pool.  Add the elevator and the parking, and you have not only a spectacular home but also an incredibly comfortable one. Why we like it? clean modern floorplan, all  in one level, with a terrace towards the front perfect for entertaining.  And if you don´t feel like going to the pool, there is always the private jacuzzi!</p>

<p>This is probably the most diverse real estate category in Casco Viejo, Panama.  You can find anything from one bedrooms to two bedrooms, with views and sometimes if you are lucky even parking.</p>

Why we like it? the building has elevator and a water view roof terrace with swimming pool.  It also has a private roof terrace with views.</p>

Note it is located on top of a restaurant. A really good one, so you might add a few pounds while living there!</p>

Why we like it? is Casco Viejo in a nutshell: colonial stone walls, water views from the roof terrace, interesting floorplan with a small private semi- open terrace that serves as a breakfast area off from the kitchen.  And parking!</p>

You might even attempt buying a parking space from a neighbor.  We also like that is on top of Casco`s best wine bars, which happens to be in front of our office. Has enough of a side water view to be featured as &#8220;water view property&#8221; but we rather leave it as a surprise when you visit.</p>

Why we like it? We like the tenant and the fact that is 30 seconds or less away from parks. Ideal if you like outdoors activities like jogging or bicycle.  It is also 10 seconds away from the Presidential Palace, in case you want to hear the gossip before it hits the local newspapers!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>For the first time ever, a group of Panamanian celebrities have joined hands to raise awareness about the importance of preserving our history.   From Panama`s former Miss Universe, to writers, painters, journalists and TV presenters, they explain not only the importance history plays in shaping the country`s identity but also talk about the specific importance of Casco Viejo as a World Heritage Site designated by UNESCO.</p>
<p>This video has sprouted out of the controversy of a government plan to build a road around Casco Viejo, destroying its natural beaches and endangering its status as an international history jewel. UNESCO has already issued a strong report regarding the road project,  which would take Casco Viejo out of the World Heritage Site list.</p>
<p>This alarm has created a grassroots movement between conservationists, members of the Casco Viejo community, artists and more.  Casco Viejo`s community has been known for its love for its neighborhood and has fought several times against actions that have attempted against its integrity.</p>
<p>Because of Panama`s role as a natural and economic hub since way before the Spanish conquest, the country has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any of its regional peers.  With the road around Casco Viejo, Panama would loose the designation for two out of three important sites: Panama La Vieja and Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>Around the World, Heritage Sites become not only the source of pride and identity of the countries they belong to, but also economic engines and important cultural and touristic trademarks that help the country differentiate itself in the crowded international market.  Each one is unique and irreplaceable, once lost, just as it happens with endangered species that are part of the chain of life on Earth&#8230; it will be forever.</p>
<p>We would like to congratulate all of the participants in this video and at the same time, would like to invite you to spread the word and support this cause:</p>
<p>Here is the youtube link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydeRkDz-HO0&amp;feature=related</p>

<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Old Quarter</p>
<p>Last night I tried some amazing ceviche and patacones. Fresh and spicy, they were the creation of Waldo, the owner of the recently opened &#8220;Ceviche&#8221; restaurant at<a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/"> Casco Viejo</a>.  Waldo has lived in Singapure, and its ceviche does show some Asian influence!</p>
<p>His restaurant is almost a Ceviche Bar, a mix between a café and a fast food. You can catch and run, or you can enjoy right there.  His labels read &#8220;All Natural, Pacific Ocean Catch, Lime &amp; Sea Salt&#8221;.   Simply delicious!</p>
<p>Location: Central Avenue and 3rd Street, next to Manolo Caracol.</p>
<p>Check out their website: www.cevichepescafina.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama City, Panama</p>
<p>A classic Panamanian tradition during Easter is to visit at least seven churches to pray and/or leave candles at their door.  <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a>, being Panama`s colonial city, makes this task quite easy as it offers several options. Among the best known are the Cathedral Church, San José`s Church (or Golden Altar), San Francisco de Asis (now closed for repairs), La Merced Church, Santa Ana Church&#8230; and the hidden and always closed to the public San Felipe Neri.</p>
<p>San Felipe Neri is located at the corner of <a title="Plaza Bolivar" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#Maps_and_Virtual_Tours/Plaza_Bolivar">Plaza Bolivar</a>. Once upon a time, it stood alone in the corner, but today it is hidden behind the convent that was later built in front and are the current headquarters of Fundacion San Felipe.</p>
<p>The foundation restored the church a couple of years ago, but left it closed to the general public. Only open for special occasions, they`ve used it for special events such as Christmas Carols and more recently for the ceremony of appointing Panama`s new Bishop.</p>
<p>This past Sunday, the church was open to visitors and I had the opportunity to take these photos.  I had seen the church &#8220;before and after&#8221; restoration&#8230; and they did a beautiful job.  One of the main pieces is the stair at the back that held the chorus.  The roof is stunning, simple and elegant. But also, what tells an even more intimate story of the Casco are its floors and walls, as back in the day they served as funerary monuments for important figures.</p>
<p>Here, you can see the plaque of Manuela Barranco de Avila, born in 1792 and deceased in 1866.  Casco Viejo was founded in 1763, so she was a full Casconian (head to toe!), living her full 74 years in a time of change that saw Panama`s first railroad be built  (1855) and the Gold Rush take over.  It would have been an amazing time, and you can only wonder if she was aware of the advances of technology and social revolts around the world.  The magnetic pole was discovered and Washington was appointed the capital for the US.  When she was only 8 years old, Napoleon conquered Italy, and when she was 12, Haiti became the first country in America to break with colonial ties. This most have been groundbreaking for Panama`s politics of the time were people from all races and background lived in peace and were busy making business.</p>
<p>She was 27 years old (and probably married and with children by then) when Simon Bolivar &#8220;liberated&#8221; the New Granada (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador), a combo we would later join after declaring independence from Spain in 1821.  She was 58 years old when this happened.  So basically, she went from being officially under Spanish rule  to being Colombian.  Did she ever feel Panamanian? back then, this little part of the World was referred to as the &#8220;Isthmus of Panama&#8221;, and many called themselves &#8220;istmeños&#8221;.  The only true thing is that Casco Viejo was her only constant environment, probably the only place she related to and called home.</p>
<p>She died the year Alfred Nobel invented the dynamite, and when Austria defeated Prussia and Italy.  She never saw the electric light, invented by Thomas Edison in 1879 which eventually led to one of the best inventions quoted in 2003 in Panama by an almost 100 year old Panamanian that was interviewed for Panama`s 100 anniversary as a Republic&#8230;. the air conditioner.</p>
<p>Back then the Panama Canal was probably only a dream.</p>
<p>I think what is amazing is that with just one look at a physical part of Casco Viejo you can touch World`s history and be truly transported.  Another reason to love this town and be part of it!</p>

<p>When I heard about the Easter Egg hunt <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">at Clementinas,</a> I confess I had flashbacks of my ballet students running all over the place, creating chaos and getting in all sorts of trouble just because they can.  But nothing even close to that! I`m happy to report it was the cutest event in the world! &#8220;hunters&#8221; got their eggs and with great surprise opened them to discover all sorts of goodies inside&#8230;</p>
<p>Happy Easter!</p>

<p>Long line on Saturday outside Las Bovedas gallery in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a>. Long line on Sunday!  Finally took a peek at the window and saw this small world of fantasy glowing from inside.   The three historic vaults were filled with carnival dresses, an exhibition put together by the Institute of Culture and the two most famous carnival queens in Panama: Las Tablas Calle Arriba and Calle Abajo.</p>
<p>Little girls with faces in awe, people taking photos everywhere. Carnival is by far one of the most enjoyed holidays in the country and Las Tablas has positioned itself as the &#8220;must see&#8221; town during the celebrations.</p>
<p>I have to say I was quite impressed with the collection, which seemed to rival even Brazil!!!</p>
<p>The show will be there until next Sunday!</p>

<p>Balconies in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a> are a way of life, I would say even better than roof terraces, because they often open directly to the living room and bedrooms.  Sometimes, small niches like the space in between the stairs that take you to the roof terrace become some sort of urban oasis.  Many have stated that we should start a balcony contest, what do you think?</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon I walked by the parking lot of <a title="National Theatre" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#Maps_and_Virtual_Tours/Teatro_Nacional">Teatro Naciona</a>l at <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a> (Panama)  and couldn´t believe the traffic.  These guys here were running into each other, happily crashing for no reason at all. Insane! People gathered around them pointing fingers.  I mean, I thought they were going to get out of their cars and either punch each other on the nose or cry for their moms.  But fortunately the voice of reason prevailed and friends came to the rescue. At the end it was all good, and they were kind enough to pose for my photo&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A gym is coming to<a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco"> Casco Viejo</a>! I really can´t wait. With so many delicious restaurants and ice cream shops we REALLY need this! And of course, not just any gym&#8230;</p>
<p>Welcome to &#8220;Top Level Gym&#8221; . Check out their<a title="Top Level Gym" href="http://www.facebook.com/TopLevelGymPanama?sk=photos"> facebook page HERE</a>.  They do martial arts, yoga and cross fit training.  This is not your classic &#8220;air conditioning, lets look cute for others -sweating out of the question&#8221; kind of gym. Here, you`ll train hard, sweat like hell and see results.</p>
<p>After being all my life either dancing ballet professionally or/and going to the gym (from the cute lycra type to the more wellness oriented type), I think I have the authority to say I really enjoyed the process at Top Level.   The first class I took was on their circuit area.  I felt amazing after that, I really thought some of it was going to be hard, but after a round or two I knew I could get it done and at the end it was even looking like a pro.  And anyone can do these routines, they adjust it to whichever level you are at.  Muscles I didn´t remember I had made their presence noticed the next day, but I was happy and ready for more.</p>
<p>Then I tried a bit of their martial arts stuff. I`ve never done anything like boxing (and much less <a title="Muay Thai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai">Muay Thai)</a> but as scary as that name looks it was quite fun!  I was sort of stock at the beginning with &#8220;punching&#8221; the guy with my hands, at some point I told him (as any ballet dancer would)&#8230; so doesn`t this thing have kicks of some sort? He smiled and said, &#8220;yes, that will be your next class&#8221;.  Sweet revenge.  You see? I`m already motivated to go back.</p>
<p>Here is the info on their Casco Viejo Intro Party:</p>
<p>Where: at Cinema Paradiso, Avenida A between 4th and 5th</p>
<p>When: April 7th, 5 to 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Healthy cocktails!!! you can also contact them at info.toplevelgym@gmail.com</p>

<p>It is always fun to see a high concentration of good looking people anywhere. And if it happens in Plaza Catedral, right here in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a>, even better!  Panama`s young fashionistas gathered at MACRO to enjoy the latest emerging designs and have fun.  The event had also an artistic side, with art installations throughout Casco, movie showings and even a graffitti workshop.  But it was hard to take the eyes off from the core of the event! even the cops were distracted, getting photos of the models at the catwalk&#8230; tsk, tsk, tsk&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p><a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama`s Historic District</a></p>
<p>For a month, the commercial space at the corner of 4th and A Avenue in Casco Viejo had been  under construction. Casco`s first fully suplied pharmacy was about to  open.  Yesterday, I couldn´t take it anymore and plastered my face  against the glass and asked: when????.  Ana Cristina, the owner, smiled while opening the door: &#8220;Tomorrow, we are still working,  but tomorrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pharmacies in Panama are a bizarre mix between a department store and a drugstore. Some go as far as selling home decoration and kitchen appliances. One of these days I`m sure I`ll be able to buy everything I need for my living room, including all electronic devices.</p>
<p>El Boticario will not sell you furniture. They are an old style pharmacy, the type that used to blend herbs according to the doctor`s recipe and have jars full of eucalipto displayed at the door. They are the only ones that still do it in the city.  It was born in <a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a>, more than 50 years ago, left town, grew to have several pharmacies in Panama City&#8230; and now is back!  El Boticario will &#8211; no doubt! &#8211;  become one of Casco`s landmarks.</p>
<p>So far, my favorite item in their shelves is something that sounds like the perfect office drug (humm&#8230; did I just say that?):  Taraxacum Officinalis.  If its scientific name puzzles you as a mix between taxes and an office, you might be thrown back by its &#8220;common&#8221; name: Diente de Leon or Lion`s Tooth.  <a title="Taraxacum Casco Viejo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum_officinale">Wikipedia </a>says it is the &#8220;Common Dandelion&#8221;. In another website I found that it is used for a bunch of stuff that goes from anemia to vision problems.</p>
<p>They also have all the other drugs, the ones that comes in pills and liquids. A small section of books and more coming! the owners are very sweet and if you live in Casco Viejo and  let them know what you need for the month, they`ll get it for you.</p>
<p>Welcome El Boticario, Casco Viejo!</p>

<p>Panama, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic District</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carnival might be over, but partying is certainly not in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a>! specially the art type. Next week, we`ll have MACRO, a festival that started last year and blended fashion with photography and art shows.  This year, they are moving into <a title="Plaza Catedral" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#Maps_and_Virtual_Tours/Plaza_de_la_Independencia">Plaza Catedral </a>(last year they were at Plaza Herrera), and will host their fashion shows on the 18th and 19th.</p>
<p>But the festival starts earlier, from March 15th, mainly with a series of movies at the Canal Museum, featuring the work of Panamanian movie directors, an industry that has been slowly growing but making very valid and interesting social commentaries.</p>
<p>Access to the Casco is going to be open to traffic and the organization has provided with buses from the nearby Cinta Costera so you can park there and just move around walking.  Casco Parking will be opening its 110 parking spots, so everyone has an option!</p>
<p>Here is the schedule for next week, all of them are free entrance, so enjoy!</p>
<p>March 15, 16 y 17, MUSEO DEL CANAL INTEROCEÀNICO.  Time: 4.30pm a 9.00pm. Panamanian Cinema at Canal Museum.</p>
<p>March 15 al 22, Diablo Rosso presents: &#8220;Public Space Interventions&#8221;.</p>
<p>March 15 al 21,  Art Show: Crossroads &#8221; ENCRUCIJADAS&#8221;  at the Gazebo in Plaza Catedral. Theme: environment, by Fundacion Albatroz</p>
<p>March 17, Art Show of Photographer  Juan Manuel Castrellon at Diablo Rosso</p>
<p>March 18 y 19 FASHION FEST en PLAZA CATEDRAL: big party with DJ, rock and more! Free entrance. Starting at 5 p.m. until midnight.</p>

<p>Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During carnivals, the country turns upside down. Almost literally, I would say everyone who has a house at the countryside or a car moves there for the holidays. So basically, Panama City (and <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a>) empties and it shows. It becomes a zen paradise, with almost no cars, nothing really going on. Very few restaurants open, so you are forced to disconnect! or to create your own fun&#8230;</p>
<p>Which is what we did!!!!</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon we organized an impromptu cocktail party at <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Clementinas</a> at the rooftop. Casqueños that &#8220;stayed behind&#8221; came and had a great time. Other than that, I enjoyed walking around, checking out the eventual group of kids with water balloons (and eggs) chasing a poor girl around to smash the egg on the head. Big smile on their faces, thoughts of retaliation were seen in her eyes.  Don`t worry, I know she`ll get them. Might not be today, nor tomorrow. But she will, no doubt about that.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I was more worried about myself walking around. I saw several getting wet under the sudden &#8220;splash&#8221; of water coming from one of the balconies. Carnival is known for that, if you don`t watch out, they`ll splash you.  My dog would have looooved it, but somehow I don`t know if I would have been as enthusiastic.  I`m glad we took the Casco Park car around, it was comfortable and kept me dry!!! Here is a photo of a group that took it around, the car works connecting parking spots throughout <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a>.</p>
<p>The other photos are from the Afroantillian Fair that was also this weekend.  It was fun to check out Panama`s Caribbean food, books and dances all in one spot. People were having a great time dancing to calypso and eating &#8220;bon&#8221; bread.  I believe the Congo Devil`s Festival is coming soon.. so keep posted! I think it is late March or maybe April.</p>

<p>Casco Viejo &#8211; Panama &#8211; Casco Antiguo</p>
<p><a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home#Home">Real Estate For Sale, For Rent </a></p>
<p><a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home#Home">At Panama`s Historic Town</a></p>
<p>The buzz is up: not only the newly built Cinta Costera is bringing more attention to Plaza Herrera, <a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home#Home">Casco Viejo</a>.  The recently started construction of American Trade Hotel has taken over the plaza. People have walked into our office looking for investment opportunities around the area, trying to buy land before the hotel opens doors.  Here is what you can buy nearby the area:</p>
<p>You don´t want to develop, just own land:</p>
<p>1. <a title="Isabella Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a008000000FzpHpAAJ"> Isabella is for you</a>.  Owning unrestored property and sit on it causes trouble and -by the way &#8211;  is illegal in Casco Viejo. Speculators are not welcomed but if you buy La Isabella you would have exactly the combination you want without the problems (plus at a very good price per mt2): a no brainer investment, nearby the newly built Cinta and steps away from the hotel. It is also income producing and highly flexible as it has parking. When the time is right, you can just go in and remodel to your taste if you like. Or not do anything and keep it renting!</p>
<p>You want to restore and you are looking for good commercial potential:</p>
<p>1. <a title="La Concordia" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a0030000006Jw9EAAS">La Concordia: </a></p>
<p>Why: Because has the highest density approved for Casco and highest commercial use: RMH2- C2. It also has a gorgeous fasade with tons of visibility as it has a commanding corner location. You can turn it into a small 20 room hotel, a fully commercial building, or a mixed use project. Your choice!</p>
<p>Price: $980,000    Area lot: 336 mt2 x 3 floors and flat roof terrace (over 1100 mt2 construction)</p>
<p>2. <a title="Casa Colonial" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a00300000075mMIAAY">Casa Colonial:</a></p>
<p>Why: It is one of the most historic properties in the block. Steps away from the hotel and from Cinta Costera, and next to Isabella. Casa Colonial is zoned for a boutique hotel but you can do commercial and residential as well.  Corner location.</p>
<p>Price: $495,000     Area lot: 288 mt2 x 2 levels plus (576 mt2 construction area)</p>
<p>3.<a title="Casa Baile" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a008000000BXU72AAH"> Casa del Baile:</a></p>
<p>Why:  Next to Casa Colonial, would give the project a lot of flexibility. On its own, it makes for a very private residential project or even a small commercial compound.</p>
<p>Price: $665,000     Area Lot: 328 mt2 x 2 levels (1050 construction area)</p>
<p>4. Casa Feraud:</p>
<p>Why: Beautiful corner location. It makes for a very good commercial development, probably all retail, although residential could be also built at the top levels.</p>
<p>Price: $900,000         Area Lot: 229 x 3 levels (no estimate of construction area available)</p>

And what better than owning a commercial space in front or nearby a hotel?  check out these options nearby the American Trade Hotel restoration project:</p>
<p>1. Best Value Purchase: Benedetti Commercial Space</p>
<p>Why:  No other commercial space can offer you the same amount of space with such elegant visibility and flexibility in terms of use.</p>
<p>Price: $1,500,000        Area: 568.96 mt2</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo &#8211; Panama &#8211; Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama`s Historic District</p>
<p>Anyone who lived through the revitalization of  Cartagena, Colombia could tell you that prices in the area (and the activity in general) gained momentum with the opening of the Santa Clara Hotel.  Currently, beautiful restored apartments in their protected historic district go from $4,000 to $7,000 per square meter, depending on amenities.</p>
<p>Today, in Casco Viejo, Panama, high end restored properties go for anything between $2,300 to close to $3,000 per mt2.  Several small hotels are already under construction, two have already opened (Canal House Panama with 3 suites and Las Clementinas with 6 fully equipped one bedroom apartments).  And this week American Trade hotel broke ground at Plaza Herrera. Fifty elegant rooms (most with plaza and water views), a convention center or events space and a jazz bar are part of the amenities that will be built in this four building compound that will be accessed from both Plaza Herrera and Central Avenue.</p>
<p>If you are looking to invest in the area and take advantage of what is to come, here is the short list of what is available now for sale on restored apartments and commercial spaces.</p>
<p>1. Best Value Purchase: <a title="Benedetti Hermanos Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a008000000FAjRjAAL">Benedetti Hermanos 1C.</a></p>
<p>Why:  Great floorplan in one level, 2 bedrooms, includes parking and building has elevator, pool and social area, which is quite unique in Casco Viejo, not to mention amenities such as central air, central gas and original WeatherShield windows.</p>
<p>Price: $440,000    Size: 174 mt2    Bedrooms: 2       Parking: yes! included.</p>
<p>2. Colonial Charm: <a title="La Merced" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a0030000006NUZrAAO">La Merced Apt 4 or 5</a></p>
<p>Why: Right next to American Trade, La Merced will be noisy for a while but at the end will be wall to wall with the hotel and has that classic &#8220;Colonial Casco&#8221; look and feel. Two bedrooms, and a private roof terrace with views. Floorplan in three levels. Building has elevator. Parking is available for individual purchase at $20,000 each.</p>
<p>Prices:</p>
<p>Unit 4  $561,591    Size: 244 mt2  Bedrooms: 2   Parking: not included. Available for Purchase.</p>
<p>Unit 5  $552,828  Size: 240 mt2  Bedrooms: 2    Parking: not included. Available for Purchase.</p>
<p>3.  Under $300,000 Options: Montefiori</p>
<p>Why: They are good one bedrooms for single tenants, and as a matter of fact both units are currently rented producing between $1100 to $1200 per month.</p>
<p><a title="Montefiori" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a0030000006KfG7AAK">Montefiori Unit 3:</a> $260,000   Area: 123 mt2   Wrap Around Balcony, One Bedroom</p>
<p><a title="Montefiori" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/PropertyDetails?propertyid=a0030000006KfFKAA0">Montefiori Unit 4:</a> $270,000  Area: 148.85 mt2  Private Roof Terrace with Water Views</p>

<p>Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo (Panama</a>)  owes its existence in more than one way to<a title="Henry Morgan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgan"> Pirate Henry Morgan </a>(or should we say Sir Henry?).  Granted, people were already looking for alternatives to move the city out of the swamp where it was originally built (Panama Viejo), but having a fearsome pirate often referred as &#8220;Brethren of the Coast&#8221; attacking your city doesn´t help either.</p>
<p>This week, an article on the findings past July 2010 of six cannons at the Caribbean coast of Panama (near San Lorenzo) made the front page. A team of professional divers found the cannons and experts point that it seemed to belong to Morgan`s flagship &#8220;Satisfaction&#8221;.  I have to say, Morgan must have had a great sense of humor!</p>
<p>The pieces will be under the care  of the Patronato de Panama la Vieja, who is in charge of the conservation of Old Panama and have commissioned several archeological studies that have brought some light on how people lived way back when. They also have a museum, so hopefully the cannons will be exhibited there.</p>
<p>Found some interesting website with the story of &#8220;Satisfaction&#8221;. <a title="Satisfaction Henry Morgan" href="http://www.hobbyworldinc.com/plast88.html">Check it out HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>I remember it clearly as if yesterday: I was so small I thought the beans were big enough to be little rocks to play with. My little hand saw the colorful cardboards full of symbols (numbers) with beans on top, all spread out, and like a bug attracted to light I went straight in their direction.  I thought to myself: &#8221; why are they there? I think I`ll just take them and play&#8221;. Never mind that the room was full of adults chatting and laughing, it didn´t register. I took all the beans with a big smile on the face, ready to take them to the garden and play with them&#8230; until I hear this scream from one of the women&#8230; &#8220;she is taking the beans!!!!&#8221;.  The room steered in confusion and chaos, screaming everywhere, lots of &#8220;no no nono!!&#8221; and some &#8220;where were the beans? which numbers?&#8221;  Who the hell knows? you mean the beans were actually doing something there?</p>
<p>Yes, they were!</p>
<p>Family Bingo has been a Panamanian tradition for ages.  A classic Sunday afternoon excuse to gather the close and extended family to have some arroz con pollo and beers, while (maybe!) making some money.  It gets to the absurd of playing it for hours and hours, one dime at a time, but each one counts! as I  learned that afternoon!</p>
<p>This past weekend,  2nd Street at <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">San Felipe, Casco Viejo</a>, was taken over by Bingo. Old ladies, everyone, chatting and laughing. I suspect nobody dared to mess up with the frijolitos as they all looked quite happy. Some of the kids even tried to play their own version of it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo, Panama</p>
<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama´s Historic District</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lion Fish is defined by <a title="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterois">Wikipedia</a> as a venomous marine fish (called Pterois).  A couple of years ago, this plague got into our side of the world by mistake and having no natural predators, this lion looking fish has dedicated itself to &#8220;la dolce vita&#8221;, eating all sorts of native species and wiping our tropical reefs. Unfortunately, it is now in Panama, and we had the opportunity to see it in San Blas, floating around, looking quite innocent to say the least!</p>
<p>However, very few know that it makes for an excellent dinner! People tend to run away when the word &#8220;poison&#8221; shows up in the phrase, thinking about the Japanese fish that can kill you in 8 seconds.  Lion Fish is far from that! The poison is only at the front and upper fins, but once it is cooked, the poison is no longer effective.  Yes, I ate it myself. It is OK!!! and delicious!!!</p>
<p>Last week, we brought to <a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a> a small group of fish aficionados to taste it.  French, German and Panamanians, they almost licked the plate at <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a>.  The first dish was presented with some soy-ginger sauce, the second with passionfruit sauce and the third one was just grilled (a la plancha), the full fish with fins and everything. Since it has most of it´s skeleton outside, there are almost no spines inside, which makes it really easy to eat.</p>
<p>Hopefully Las Clementinas will be able to include this new delicacy on the menu soon! and allow humans to do what they do best&#8230; but this time helping the environment!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a wild Sunday! went up surfing really early and then to <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas Cafe </a>in<a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/"> Casco Viejo</a> to check out the new brunch movement in town: Brunch Industries.  People started coming from every direction, smiles everywhere,  ready for unlimited mimosas, bloody marys and a nice breakfast.  The party took over the VIP event garden, while the normal cafe upstairs that served the regular brunch menu got packed.  I have to say I personally ate way too much! but couldn´t stop&#8230; everything was so delicious! good thing I had planned for a long walk later in the afternoon, so I wouldn´t feel all that guilty.</p>
<p>Brunch Industries is organized by our friend Carolina Salvat and has been an immediate success. The idea is to do every brunch in a different place and have fun! not sure where the &#8220;next coup&#8221; will be, so if you are interested let us known and we`ll put you in touch!</p>

<p>Weekend is here! Thursday, Friday and Saturday tend to be the more active nights in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo.</a> Yesterday, Di Vino hosted a wine tasting while today Los Del Patio will have a small event featuring Seth Pettersen.  Platea will have their usual salsa night, followed by rock n roll (tomorrow).</p>
<p>La Vecindad, Mojitos Sin Mojitos and La Casona will be great spots to pass by and grab a beer with your friends.  If you are looking for a local dinner probably Bohemios or Cedros could be your choice. Plaza Bolivar will lighten up with its selection of Peruvian cuisine, ceviche, Italian and Sushi.</p>
<p>But if you want a romantic early start (always a good thing to impress the girls) don´t miss <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a> gardens or cafe either for dinner or an early cocktail. Ask for their basil martini!</p>

<p><a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama`</a>s historic district,  has always a hidden surprise waiting for you somewhere. From the beautiful to the truly bizarre! last week walking by the beach nearby the old Club Union I bumped into this broken fishing boat. Chispa went bananas smelling everything like crazy, going in and out, scratchin`sniffin`.  It must have lost its anchor at high tide and then destroyed bumping against the wide rock bed.  Nature has its ways! I thought about how curious it looked clashing against the big buildings at the back. This little fishing boat in many ways recalled images of an almost lost way of living for urban creatures who (like me) pretty much  think fish comes from the supermarket.   How fragile our perception of civilization is and how incredible to bump into this here and now.</p>
<p>Yes, it is 5 p.m. and I need some serious sugar bust.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo &#8211; Casco Antiguo &#8211; Panama</p>
<p>Our Turff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love is in the air&#8221;&#8230; with St. Valentine so near you can almost taste the strawberries with cream (smell the roses!) , it might be a good moment to sit back and think about why we love <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a>!</p>
<p>I have quite a list&#8230; but before I get into it, would like to invite anyone reading this blog to send us your reasons!</p>
<p>1. You can walk everywhere: since I moved to Casco I developed an allergy to cars and traffic&#8230; and found out that I really, really, don`t depend on them to do and get what I need (at least not all the time!!!). And I love it!</p>
<p>2. You get to know everyone and everyone gets to know you!and your dog, and your kids, etc.</p>
<p>3.  You can be yourself: dress as crazy or conservative as  you want&#8230;  nobody will even notice.</p>
<p>4.  We have a surf break: hey, no one in Panama City has one! Plus, one of Panama´s best female surfers is from the neighborhood&#8230;</p>
<p>5. We have beaches: again, nobody in the rest of Panama City has them! the best kept secret&#8230; shhhhhhh.   Only turtles know it. They came last December to pay a visit.</p>
<p>6. Good neighborhood with good people: people who gets involved with non profits that work in the barrio, people who help other people just because it is your neighbor, people who volunteer, people who says &#8220;hi&#8221; to you in the street and kids who ask how your dog is doing. How not to love that?</p>
<p>7.  It is the Artistic Heart of Panama: most art festivals base in Casco Viejo (Jazz Fest, Theatre Fest, Dance Fest, Art Block) . From big to small, just spend a couple of weeks here, you`ll feel the art vibe.</p>
<p>8. We Protect, We  Fight: Casconians are very protective of their barrio, proud of their UNESCO designation and will fight to the teeth against anything that threatens its position as a World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>9. Proud of being a mixed neighborhood&#8221;:  mix of architectural styles, mix of socioeconomic levels, mix of people and friends in the street&#8230; mix, mix, mix. I bet Casco Viejo is the most diverse part of Panama City (mt2 by mt2). This is the one place where rich and poor mix in Panama and everyone gets along well. Daniel Craig stayed in Casco Viejo for two months and no one even noticed! Panamanians living outside Casco Viejo tend to refer to Casconians as &#8220;crazy&#8221;. Yes! we are! and we love it&#8230;</p>
<p>10. Summer is a constant party: kids in the street playing, dancers jump in the street for an impromptu performance and disappear and you can actually fly kites at Las Bovedas.</p>
<p>10-1 Rainy Season is also a party: with so many churches and quite some schools, there is always a parade going on!</p>
<p>11. You can go to the police and they`ll actually try to help you&#8230; and most times with a smile!</p>
<p>12.  Casco Viejo is the most romantic place of Panama City: Where else could you stroll by four different plazas in a Sunday afternoon with your kids or holding hands with the love of your life?</p>
<p>13. It is the ONLY place in Panama City where you can give addresses like: corner of 4th Street and A Avenue.  Streets here HAVE numbers and ARE organized.</p>
<p>14.  Casco has a high concentration of success stories and everyday heroes.</p>
<p>15. You can jog to secondary rainforest (Cerro Ancon), have spectacular views of Panama`s Bay and be back in less than an hour.</p>
<p>16. You have balconies as opposed to all-closed-air-conditioning-glass-box-apartments. Balconies to share with your friends, grow tomatoes,  landscape and make the town even more beautiful and interesting.</p>
<p>17. You know that if you are hungry at 1 p.m. and all you have is $0.25 you`ll be able to grab a tamal from the &#8220;tamal&#8221; guy or at 5 p.m. buy a &#8220;boyo&#8221; from the &#8220;boyo man&#8221;.</p>
<p>18. You can have it both ways: Casco`s town lifestyle and modern Panama City, as Casco Viejo is only 5 minutes away (by car) or 10 minutes away (jogging) from crazy modern Panama.</p>
<p>19.  A good place to base: add to the list less than 15 minutes away from the local airport and 20 minutes away from Panama`s international airport.</p>
<p>20.We have the Best Jazz school of Panama run by Panamanian Grammy winner Danilo Perez.</p>
<p>21. Because The Rest of Panama City <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Comes to Casco</span> When They Want to Show <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Who They Are/ Where They Came From</span> to Foreigners.  Should I write this in bold letters?</p>

<p>Last night, thirteen businesses in <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Antiguo</a> hosted thirteen artists.  It was quite fun to run around to check each one out: from sexy belly dancing and painting to amazing breakdancing or bizarre sculpture. The night started at <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas,</a> where the gardens filled with music from the young musicians of the <a title="Danilo Perez Foundation" href="http://www.fundaciondaniloperez.org/daniloperez.html">Danilo Perez Jazz Foundation</a>. But after that, you could &#8220;roam freely&#8221; and check out the 13 spots marked on the art block map: Relic, Antar, Mojitos, Super Gourmet, Diablo Rosso, Junglewood Gallery,  Forchetta, La Casona, Galería Vida, Papiro y Yo, Los del Patio, Tequila, Frit Arts, Platea, Espacio Panama, Ciao Pescao, Carlos Weil Gallery, Bohemios Restaurant, Segafreddo, Reprosa, Cafe Saint Phillipe, DiVino and La Vecindad.</p>

<p>Art Block started a few years ago as a small neighborhood party in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a> (Panama), where a couple of businesses brought artists to do some fun live painting on the streets and so on. The event was a complete success and it has been growing ever since. This year, Art Block is sponsored by almost 20 companies and the event is gearing up to be our own &#8220;cascotropical&#8221; version of Art Basel (ejem&#8230;. well! you can have aspirations, no?).</p>
<p>We still don´t have exactly what happen and where, so just come to the Casco and find out! it promises to be everywhere!  Starting at 7 p.m. till 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night we were walking our dog nearby<a title="Las Clementinas Casco Viejo" href="http://lasclementinas.com/"> Las Clementinas</a> at Casco Viejo when I heard laughter rising louder and louder.  Chispa, who loooovesss children, started pulling me like crazy towards the small placita (Plaza Arango) and there they were: bunch of kids playing as kids used to play! Somehow nostalgia took over when I saw them all cramped up at the flag pole trying to climb on each other to see how many could fit at the same time in such small space.  They kept falling like apples from a tree (well, falling or being pushed&#8230; jejeje) .</p>
<p>Then they quickly came to say hi to the dog and decided on another game: the classic jumping on top of each other like frogs.  I had not seen that one in a while!!!! at least not performed naturally in the street, I teach it at my ballet school, but most of the time I get blank stares from the girls at the beginning, because they really don`t know what I`m talking about. When they finally get it, they have a blast&#8230; but these kids at the street where doing it naturally&#8230; as it used to be before videogames took over. Deep breath and sigh!</p>
<p>And this hasn´t been the first time I´ve seen them &#8220;just having fun&#8221;. Last time they had the classic long rope and where actually jumping in it, something that seems now an image pulled out from a vintage magazine. Not to mention the group I saw a month ago at Las Bovedas sliding full speed on a big piece of cardboard down the stairs, big smile on their faces.</p>
<p>Walking back, we passed by the Cathedral plaza. Another group of kids were on bikes and those who weren´t started some sort of football game where somehow the main objective seemed to be to pile up on top of the one kid. You sort of feel bad about it for a second (specially if it happened to you back in the days), but it is also part of growing up. I think parents back then used to call it &#8220;character building&#8221; or being a good sport. You always had your chance to get back to your friends on the next round.  When the kids stood up I saw the one at the bottom and he had a huge smile on his face. Stood up immediately and started running after the others.  The game continued, probably with another consenting victim at the bottom of the human pile.</p>
<p>Somehow I believe this social interaction with games that put your physical energy to work and by the way teaches you team work and social behavior is valuable and should not be lost.  I`m glad Casco Viejo is still full of kids that jump rope, slide stairs and do silly games. Somehow I think it fits well with this 338 year old colonial town, and even more, it fits well with being  human.</p>

<p>Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama City`s Historic District</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week was a hectic one! the opening of Los del Patio and several other events had us going out a lot.  One of the best discoveries of last week was &#8220;La Vecindad&#8221;, <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo`s </a>new bar and hangout place at Avenida A, right in front of the Art Deco building between Calle 4ta and 5ta, and next to Bohemios.</p>
<p>Run by Nico and Idalibeth from the ex gang in Calle 4ta,  La Vecindad is located in an unrestored building.  Walking in, you feel right at home. Open spaces and gardens that show all the textures of charming Casco Viejo.  Spaces like this open golden opportunities for locals to develop their ideas and grow with the neighborhood. We encourage more owners to open up their unrestored buildings and keep providing the neighborhood with such interesting places!</p>
<p>Congratulations to La Vecindad!</p>

<p><a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Real Estate For Sale, For Rent</a></p>
<p><a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">At Panama`s Historic City</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, Panama`s artistic community gathered at the <a title="Contemporary Art Museum" href="http://www.macpanama.org/acerca_del_mac/personal.html">Contemporary Art Museum </a>to check out the art show &#8220;00-10: Cuenta Progresiva &#8211; Art during Panama`s first decade of the XXI Century&#8221;. An interesting compilation made by Reinier Rodríguez, an architect and Casconian.</p>
<p>The show was well put together and it starts an important conversation in Panama`s artistic circles  about who/ what is/ was relevant on this first decade.  It featured several artists, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that<a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco"> Casco Viejo</a> lovers (alias Casconians, whether owners, residents or fans-always-there-you-think-they-live-here or hardcore supporters) were quite a few. There was <a title="Eduardo Navarro" href="http://www.eduardonavarroq.com/index2_eng.html">Eduardo Navarro</a> with his beautiful horses, <a title="Jonathan Harker" href="http://www.jonathanharker.com/">Jonathan Harker</a> with video, <a title="Miky Fabrega" href="http://www.mikyfabrega.com/">Miky Fabrega</a>, <a title="Francisco Barsallo" href="http://franciscobarsallo.blogspot.com/">Francisco Barsallo</a>, <a title="Rachelle Mozman" href="http://www.rachellemozman.com/">Rachelle Mozman</a>, <a title="Jean Jacques Ribi" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jean-Jacques-Ribi/49176692589">Jean Jacques Ribi </a>and Yiyi Ibarra among others.  Go check it out, the show will be on for the next two months.</p>
<p>After you go see it, pass by <a title="Diablo Rosso" href="http://www.diablorosso.com/">Diablo Rosso</a> (at A Avenue and 7th Street, Casco Viejo) and check out their show called &#8220;Complementarios&#8221; (Complementary) which features artists that are also considered relevant by this group and were not included in the first show.  Compare and analyze with a cup of coffee or wine! chat and feed the fire!</p>
<p>Finally, if you happen to do all of it today and want to close your day with another artistic event, pass by Calle 3ra and check out Yiyi Ibarra`s inauguration of Los Del Patio, an art space that is opening next to the National Theatre.  They are putting together a theater festival during February, so keep your eyes and ears open!</p>

<p>Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say you are from &#8220;el patio&#8221; in Panama (which literally means from the &#8220;backyard&#8221;) you are saying you are a local.  &#8220;Los Del Patio&#8221; is a theatre and dance space that is just opening (formally, since they`ve already started theatre courses for kids ) at Calle 3era, next to the National Theatre at Panama`s 338 year old Colonial City (<a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a>).</p>
<p>Their debut is tonight, and will feature an art show by <a title="Donna Conlon" href="http://www.donnaconlon.com/">Donna Conlon</a> and <a title="Jonathan Harker" href="http://www.jonathanharker.com/bio-esp">Jonathan Harker</a>. The show is called &#8220;Videogames&#8221;. Nothing to do with Mario Bros or World of Warcraft! It is a collection where the hands of both artists play with left over construction materials from Casco Viejo, Bella Vista and Diablo (former Canal Zone). They wanted to create awareness about how memory is lost when a site is transformed.</p>
<p>I`m glad they are bringing this to the table as it is a simple truth. I see it every day, when people come to Casco, their memories of what used to be there are linked to the building itself. In our case, we are lucky: our preservation laws force developers to keep the fasade, so a memory remains.  Other sites in Panama, such as Bella Vista (which still has a handful&#8230;.but only a handful of historic buildings) are lost forever.  Even when you force your memory to go back and remember the place as it used to be, something gets really blurry and confusing.</p>
<p>The art show is about the collective memory of the City of Panama. So go take a look tonight! Calle 3era and Central Avenue, 7:30 p.m.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama,<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/"> Casco Viejo, Casco Antigu</a>o</p>
<p>Real Estate at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Oficina del Casco Antiguo started a series of activities to celebrate the 338th Anniversary of Casco Viejo.  For those already tuned into our beloved historic city,  its history will be familiar:  back in 1671 the first settlers of what is now called &#8220;Old Panama&#8221; decided to move out of their site (located in a swamp, basically) to a more healthy area (rocky point! ) that had crossed wind ventilation and less mosquitoes.  There is an endless discussion on whether the last attack of pirate Morgan was really the trigger for the city to move out, I think they were already having such a bad time with tropical diseases nobody knew about that by the time Morgan came the city was already weak and ready to go.</p>
<p>This is the first time I recall that the actual move from one city to the next one is being celebrated. Most of the activities will be held at Casa de la Cultura with seminars and talks about preservation.  The Canal Museum will hold a conference on the 18th (today) at 10 a.m. about the tourism influence of the Casco Antiguo and at 11:45 a.m. Dra. Katty Osorio will talk about the &#8220;Moving of the City and Continuity at Panama Vieja&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, January 19th, the Canal Museum will have two conferences: 10 a.m. about urban planning and &#8220;museum &amp; Casco Viejo&#8221;.    As an interactive activity, they are are asking participants to bring newspaper cuttings which will be gathered in a &#8220;time chest&#8221; and closed to be open in 10 years.  Hope they keep it in the Canal Museum!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama &#8211; Casco Viejo &#8211; Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Plaza Catedral</p>
<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rain! nooooooooooo&#8230;&#8230; People were prepared, though: everyone took their umbrellas out and scouted the sky to see if this was going to last. Classic Panamanian prediction:  &#8220;Nah&#8230; it will be gone in an hour or less. Good that it happened early&#8221;.  And so it happened: rained came and left, but the concert started on time at 12 noon and little by little <a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Plaza Catedral at Casco Viejo</a> started to get people in.  I was staged at a friend`s apartment (thank you Luis!!!! you are the best!!!!).</p>
<p>I am always impressed with the Festival.  The quality of their event is really incredible and you never think they can top it the next year, but they do.   Patricia Zarate and Danilo Perez have the &#8220;magic touch&#8221;.  And this year was extra special, as Danilo just published his latest work &#8220;Providence&#8221; and Patricia just had her first baby boy: Danilo Jr.</p>
<p>With all this going on, they still had energy to put together a world class fest with guests like Claudia Acuña, Adam Cruz, Rudresh Mahanthappa, Conrad Herwig, Paoli Mejias, Alain Perez, Riccardo Del Fra, Ben Street, Bryan Lynch, Jorge Perez González and a lot more.  They put together educational workshops throughout the entire week and found the time to audition and award four fellowships.  Their commitment to raise the bar both on music  performance and education in Panama is admirable and wanted to thank both of them through this post of the amazing work they are doing through the <a title="Fundacion Danilo Perez" href="http://www.fundaciondaniloperez.com/">Fundacion Danilo Perez</a> and the<a title="Panama Jazz Fest" href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/english/"> Panama Jazz Fest Inc.</a></p>
<p>The photos will speak for themselves: everyone enjoyed this event to the fullest.  Casco Viejo turned into a big musical party that went on all night, even after the concert had ended.  The Catedral became a beautiful backdrop for the event. The ambiance was fantastic&#8230; &#8220;love was in the air&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>One last word to all the volunteers that worked day and night on the Festival: THANK YOU!!!! This year I was backstage and could see them running like crazy, helping everywhere. Many of them music students that had the opportunity to mix with great legends of jazz and learn from them.  Their devotion to the festival makes it possible, and the guidance of the pro &#8211; team makes it world class.</p>
<p>For all the team at the Fest, for Danilo &amp; Patricia and everyone at the Foundation:  you guys rock!!!</p>
<p>See you next year!!!</p>

<p>Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night was the inauguration of the <a title="Panama Jazz Festival" href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/english/">Panama Jazz Festival</a> at the National Theatre in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo,</a> Panama.  I was lucky to be backstage and enjoy the great music and musicians! this photo is from part of their rehearsal an hour or so before opening curtains.</p>
<p>My favorite last night was the <a title="Harlem Quartet" href="http://www.harlemquartet.com/bios.html">Harlem String Quartet</a>.  I noticed that, while with a dancer or an actor you can forever wonder whether they are the same on stage (or film) as in real life (and there are hundreds of magazines that exist only to &#8220;reveal&#8221; whether they are or not!)&#8230; with musicians you have the answer straight out: they are what you see and listen to! They can´t help it! And this was the case of the Harlem Quartet. They were so much fun backstage, making jokes, always with a smile.  I had never listened to their work, so I was wondering how it would be. They came out&#8230; and had a blast! the audience enjoyed every fun piece executed both with mastery and great spirits. No wonder one of their main activities is education.  To be a great teacher you have to know how to capture your audience and keep them with you&#8230; and boy did they know!fantastic.</p>
<p>There was also the abstract piece by the Conservatorio de Paris, directed by <a title="Riccardo Del Fra" href="http://www.riccardodelfra.net/">Riccardo Del Fra.</a> Let`s face it: jazz sometimes can get into some imaginative lands! these guys were as creative as it could get, I don`t think I`ve ever seen the trumpet being played like this before.</p>
<p>And finally&#8230; but not least important, the <a title="Victor Paz" href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/english/dedicated-to-vitin-paz.html">Vitín Paz</a> performance with his Big Band.It was amazing to see him play, seating elegantly with his tall hat.  And the kids at the band were playing at their best, sharing the scene with seasoned international artists. <a title="Danilo Perez" href="http://www.daniloperez.com/">Danilo Pérez</a> himself was smiling, dancing on and off stage. The night ended (for us!) around 11 p.m.  But the gang was fired up with energy&#8230; straight to a jam session that lasted (I`m sure) till 1 a.m. !</p>

<p>While every year, the festival has organized free transportation from Cinta Costera, this year the bus will leave from Multicentro (note! not Multiplaza) in Paitilla.  Multicentro Mall has about 3000 parking spaces. Ten buses will be available, taking people back and forth for free. They`ll work from 10 a.m. till 10 p.m. (and probably later). And if you would like to just &#8220;walk back&#8221; to your car, then the walk is only 20 minutes using the Cinta Costera!</p>
<p>Stickers will be provided to residents and business owners/ employees. This is coordinated by the Oficina del Casco Antiguo, so if you live or work in Casco be sure to get your sticker on time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo &#8211; Casco Antiguo &#8211; Panama</p>
<p>Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at</p>
<p>Panama`s Historic District</p>
<p>Holidays always leave me as crushed as a soda can after being hit by a truck&#8230; twice (you know: going forward and then back!).  So finally I can post about our party at <a title="Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/">Las Clementinas</a> in Casco Viejo and upload some interesting photos.</p>
<p>First of all, let`s just make a big disclosure: <a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a> is a loud place during holidays.  Normally on Fridays you can hear music in more than one corner, but specially during New Year they take special pride to embrace certain Panamanian traditions such as exploding those small &#8220;bombitas&#8221; (little bombs) in the streets.  Full belts of bombitas, noise and smoke all over. But the best is the construction of the &#8220;dolls&#8221;.</p>
<p>In fact, if you are in Panama during Año Nuevo, and you happen to drive towards the countryside, you`ll see hundreds of life-size dolls in different &#8220;everyday&#8221; poses by the highway.  From people you hate to people you admire, from dictators to your favorite uncle, in New Year you get the pleasure of exploding them all just for the fun of the ear deafening noise. Somehow I think this is our Chinese cultural influence&#8230;</p>
<p>So at Calle 2nda the kids built a doll of one of their uncles:<a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/casco-viejo-doll.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3032" title="Casco Viejo doll" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/casco-viejo-doll.jpg?w=112" alt="" width="112" height="150" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/casco-viejo-doll.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/casco-viejo-doll-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px" /></a></p>
<p>Usual suspects here:</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-brat-pack-casco-viejo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3033" title="the brat pack Casco Viejo" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-brat-pack-casco-viejo.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="112" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/the-brat-pack-casco-viejo.jpg 1024w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/the-brat-pack-casco-viejo-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we went to Las Clementinas to enjoy the fireworks.  For those who were not there, let`s try to describe it.  You know, Panamanians are not famous for keeping an exact sense of time.  Unlike the British or German, we like &#8220;keeping it loose&#8221; and add an &#8220;ish&#8221; to the hour. Well, about 10 or 15 minutes before time, the &#8220;storm&#8221; started.  Also, let`s point out we don`t believe in organized anything, unless it is Carnival.  So our firework show isn`t like this pompous or orchestrated thing where stuff is choreographed into rivers of light rushing into the sky&#8230; no no no&#8230;. we are an eclectic bunch and we love it.</p>
<p>So, Calidonia and Plaza 5 de Mayo claimed the first fireworks of the night (regardless it was not even close to midnight) and after them,  Chorrillo started setting out theirs. Finally the official midgnight countdown came and the bay sent their own, the Balboa Yatch Club (very nice ones!) and two sets in Casco Viejo: Plaza Bolivar and Plaza Catedral.</p>
<p>From Las Clementinas roof terrace Panama City looked like being bombed. Fro<a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img-20101231-00156.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3034" title="Casco Viejo Fireworks" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img-20101231-00156.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="234" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/img-20101231-00156.jpg 1213w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/img-20101231-00156-300x234.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/img-20101231-00156-1024x799.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>m ever</p>
<p>ywhere you could see beautiful light flowers exploding into the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the party, we headed with some friends to <a title="Canal House Panama" href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/">Canal House</a> and decided to close our evening with a Caribbean and Panama Rum Tasting involving ten different rums .  Being already &#8220;in tune&#8221; with the activity, we decided to actually take it serious .  It was to be a blind tasting (only the person pouring it knew which one was which) and we were to grade them from 1 to 10 in a chart.  We all sipped the first round and made comments. Of course, on some of them we needed to &#8220;re confirm&#8221; our thoughts (thoughts?) so we kept doing rounds &#8220;just to make sure&#8221;.  After all, it was an international competition and participants needed to &#8220;get it right&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/rum-tasting-casco-viejo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3035" title="Rum Tasting Casco Viejo" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/rum-tasting-casco-viejo.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rum-tasting-casco-viejo.jpg 1024w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rum-tasting-casco-viejo-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Well&#8230; our conclusion basically was: all of them were good. But of course, Zacapa (Guatemala) took the lead, very close by Panamanian rum Abuelo and by Appleton rum.  I`m not much of a rum drinker myself, so I`m posting my chart for you to get a laugh at: <a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/casco-viejo-chart.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3036" title="casco viejo chart" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/casco-viejo-chart.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/casco-viejo-chart.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/casco-viejo-chart-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>

<p><a title="Real Estate Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home#Home">Real Estate and Lifestyle at Panama`s Historic District</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a title="Panama Jazz Festival" href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/english/">Panama Jazz Festival</a> has been growing steadily year by year, flooding Panama and <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a> with great music and fantastic vibe.  After 8 years of attending the Jazz Fest, I`ve put together a couple of recommendations for those of you thinking on attending for the first time:</p>
<p>1. Buy your tickets in advance: this way you`ll make sure you have the ones you really want and for the events you are most interested in.  While the Anayansi theatre at Atlapa has a capacity for almost 3000 people, the National Theatre can only hold 800.  Also, some of the events are going to be held at one of the smaller areas (Salon San Lorenzo) which has a lower capacity. You won`t need tickets for the outdoors concert in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a>! If you haven`t seen the schedule yet, you can <a title="Panama Jazz Fest" href="http://panamacascoviejo.wordpress.com/2010/12/29/panama-jazz-festival-is-almost-here-concert-calendar/">FIND IT HERE. </a></p>
<p>2. The workshops are really good!: if you are thinking on signing up your kid or attending yourself if you are a musician, again, you probably need to sign up in advance. Contact Alida for the <a title="Clinics Jazz Fest" href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/clinics/">Workshops HERE. </a></p>
<p>Now&#8230; for the concert at Casco Viejo:</p>
<p>1. Stay in Casco Viejo: it is the best way to enjoy the festival. You just walk to the plaza and back home. Check out our list of recommended hotels and private apartments for rent <a title="Hotels Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco/What_To_Do">HERE</a>. If you are not staying in Casco and are coming from Panama City:</p>
<p>2. Leave your car outside at Cinta Costera:  believe me, it is the best strategy. I`ve tried it myself and it works. Every year they have a shuttle service, so there is no need to stress about parking. The shuttle will bring you back. And even if you want to leave between shuttle rides, you can actually just walk out using the Cinta Costera extension. It is very easy!</p>
<p>3. Seating comfortably:  you will have a good time no matter what, even if you sit on the floor. However, I`ve always been grateful for those who offered me their folding chair (you know, those camping chairs that fold into almost a tube).  These chairs are fantastic: almost no weight and no hassle.  This year the festival is going to provide with more seating areas, but just in case go prepared! and remember to wear comfortable clothing and shoes.</p>
<p>4. Goodies: no need for them unless you have a special food need. You`ll find people selling anything from water, beers, soda, and food.</p>
<p>5. Bathrooms:  the Fest always have several rows of public bathrooms, usually near the Canal Museum. If anything&#8230; bring paper with you!</p>
<p>6. Casco Style VIP areas: the Panama Jazz Festival always has a small VIP area, which is a nice way to check out the concert. But also there is the &#8220;Casco Style VIP&#8221; = knowing anybody that has a balcony overlooking Plaza Catedral.  Most owners are holding parties for their friends on that day&#8230; so just drop by! bring some good wine and cheese!</p>

<figure id="attachment_2938" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img_6086.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2938" title="Casco Viejo Panama" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img_6086.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">La Merced at Night 2010</figcaption></figure>
<p>For a while now, the priest at La Merced Church has been working hard to recover the treasures of one of the oldest churches in<a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo</a>, Panama.  He recently commissioned (and finished) the restoration of one of the chapels and built a small museum that hosts the birth and marriage records of what used to be Panama City.  This past week, an expert was brought to check on the old bells and see if they could be restored. Manuel Quintana, a descendant of  a family dedicated to build and restore bells since 1639 came to check La Merced set of old bells.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img_3412.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2939" title="IMG_3412" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img_3412.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>And what a surprise! according to La Prensa`s article yesterday, the expert found out that the big bell is from year 1232&#8230; which means that it is 778 years old! Think about it.   Casco Viejo was founded in 1673 (<a title="Casco Viejo History" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">see brief history here</a>) . La Merced was built in 1688 (according to the article construction finished in 1796.. almost 108 years later, you know, for those thinking construction in Panama takes time and is always delayed for one reason or the other).  And since the religious order came to Panama in 1522, it means that they probably shipped with them bells they were not really using too much (I can guess the conversation went like: hey, bring me the old one, yes, the dusty one in the corner. We are not using it, right? let`s send it to the New Indias).  Yeah, the already 200 year old bell!</p>
<p>The sad part is that according to Mr. Quintana, the bells are cracked in a way it is impossible to repair.  But he recommended to declare them of &#8220;cultural interest&#8221; as they are extremely rare, for most bells of the same period got destroyed.</p>
<p>The best: the bells where signed.  Each one a unique piece by an artisan, La Merced bells have the signature of Imanuel Perea.</p>
<p>Here are some &#8220;before and after&#8221; photos of La Merced Church, which used to greet visitors into San Felipe through what was called the &#8220;Land Door&#8221;.</p>

<p>Panama Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Investment at Panama`s Historic City</p>
<p>For the last ten years, Panama built a reputation as a tax haven for foreigners, highlighting through its marketing the low taxes in Panamanian system and the discount benefits for retirees within the country. However, this strategy seem to backfire, including the country in several black lists around the world.</p>
<p>Since then, the government started a campaign to educate about the basis of Panama`s tax system (where they charge taxes on all income produced in Panama) and sign treaties with different countries to avoid double taxation.</p>
<p>This week, Panama and the United States signed a Tax Cooperation Agreement where there will be exchange of information.  The text has just been published by the US Treasury and can be <a title="Tax Agreement" href="http://www.panamcham.com/doc/upload/2010tiea.pdf">found HERE. </a></p>

<p>Panama Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Real Estate Investments at Panama`s Historic District</p>
<p>First page news: Panamanian government will invest $30 million dollars in <a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo </a>starting 2011.</p>
<p>According to an interview made to Dario Cadavid from Oficina del Casco Antiguo and published today at La Prensa, the infrastructure plan for Casco Antiguo (sewage, underground cables, water pipes, electricity, etc) has been quoted at $30 million. The plans include a visitor center at the old Casa del Arte for $1.7 million (with a $600,000 contribution from the Spanish Agency of International Cooperation / AECI) , and the restoration of all the lighting system ($4.3 millions).  The lighting project should start in 2011.</p>
<p>They are also hoping to start the restoration of the roofs of several churches, such as La Merced, which has recently restored one of the oldest &#8220;capillas&#8221; in Casco through private donations.</p>
<p>Although the article wasn´t clear whether the full amount was already funded (or still in fundraising)  and planned to be invested in 2011 or if there was already an existing chronogram by stages showing what/ where/ when the works would get started, this publication is a positive step towards the right direction, specially after UNESCO`s visit last month where some of the issues related to infrastructure were discussed.</p>

<p>Panama Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Real Estate For Sale For Rent at Panama`s Historic District</p>
<p>When you think that just a couple of years ago airlines around the World were going through one of the biggest economic crisis of modern history this headline becomes simply amazing. But truth is that<a title="COPA" href="http://www.copaair.com/sites/GS/es/Pages/homepage.aspx"> COPA </a>, Panama`s flag airline, never stopped moving forward.  Even through the darkest days, COPA never stopped offering meals to their clients and good service.</p>
<p>Yesterday, and according to a note from La Prensa, the airline signed what is quoted to be the largest transaction in the history between Panama and the United States: $2,600 million dollars for the purchase of 32 brand new Boeing airplanes.</p>
<p>One of <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_Panama" target="_blank">Panama`s</a> strongest assets is its geographic position. From colonial times, it positioned itself as a hub for 1. Spanish trade with the Americas, 2. Gold trade with California, 3. General trade with the Panama Canal.  This advantage had given companies like COPA a great platform to develop as what is known today as the Hub of the Americas. Among COPA`s plans there is for the first time an interest to reach internal destinations within Panama, through shared codes with Aeroperlas and Air Panama. But hopefully this new purchase means more and better planes to continue to connect the world through our small country.</p>

<p>Oh Boy, oh boy.  Now I`m in trouble. A beautiful wine bar is opening right in front of <a title="Arco Properties, Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Arco Properties</a> office at <a title="Casco Viejo, Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco">Casco Viejo</a>, Panama.   I confess myself to be a cheese fanatic, and <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.enotecadivino.com/ubicacion.html">Di Vino </a>(which means &#8220;divine&#8221; in Spanish, but in Italian means &#8220;about wine&#8221;) has not only a wonderful ambiance but great cheeses and &#8211; of course- wines.  Italian wines, to be more specific, as Di Vino belongs to three good Italian friends (Milan, Rome) and Casco Viejo neighbors: Denis, Jacopo and Francesco.</p>
<p>Built with great taste and using wood and glass, you`ll enjoy hanging out there. And if after a couple of good Chianti you feel like buying real estate&#8230; just crawl to the building in front and visit us!!!!</p>

<p>Casco Antiguo Panama</p>
<p>Real Estate For Sale, For Rent at Panama`s Historic District</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hospitals are probably the last thing in your mind when you decide to travel. However, if you need to replace your knee and you are facing a probable $50,000 bill, it might actually make sense to buy a plane ticket&#8230; and why not <a title="About Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_Panama" target="_blank">Panama</a>?</p>
<p>Today, La Prensa`s financial magazine Martes Financiero, published a piece on &#8220;health tourism&#8221;. While it has been known for a while that health costs in Panama are lower than in the United States (for example), and that most doctors (specialists, surgeons) have had training in the States (many of them holding licenses to operate there as well) it seems to be only now that Panamanian hospitals are getting organized to attract this type of tourism.</p>
<p>The paper quoted that a knee replacement, for example, costs about $50,000 in the United States and about $12,000 in Panama.  Hip replacement is about the same difference $50,000 in the States and $13,000 in Panama. Of course, you also have the cosmetic choices such as liposuction ($3,000 vs USA`s $9,000) and even &#8220;in vitro&#8221; fertilization ($3,000 vs $14,500).</p>
<p>Hospitals like Hospital Punta Pacífica, which has an affiliation with the John Hopkins Hospital have a department focused on foreigners due to the increasing number of visitors.  Most of them coming to get cardiovascular, orthopedic and fertility treatments.  I would say dentists are also in demand, a cleaning here (good one) could be from $60 to $80.</p>
<p>From <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, </a>Panama`s 300 year old colonial city,  some hospitals (like Hospital Nacional or even Punta Pacifica) are reachable in less than 15 minutes by car.  Being a small city, most hospitals are reachable within 40 minutes, even with traffic.  Staying in Casco and scheduling your medical procedure might be one of the best ways to blend &#8220;tourism&#8221; with &#8220;health&#8221;.  Everything is walking distance: bars, restaurants and theaters.  No traffic rush necessary, just walk around.</p>
<p>However, it is important to meet with the doctors and be comfortable with the person who will be looking at your specific case.  In Panama, asking for references is an easy way to get information, as it is such a small country! reputation travels fast.  However, the USA Embassy published once a list of doctors that might be a great place to start.   <a title="Doctors in Panama" href="http://panama.usembassy.gov/medical2010.html" target="_blank">Click HERE to go to the list. </a></p>

<p>After the obvious excesses of last night`s  <a title="Casco Viejo Thanksgiving " href="http://panamacascoviejo.wordpress.com/2010/11/26/fun-casco-viejo-thanksgiving-party/">Casco Viejo Thanksgiving party </a>(not that I regret anything, specially the two mountain size plates I ate of corn cake), all I can think about now is how to get rid of this annoying guilt and full stomach feeling. I mean, I have to make room for tonight`s debut of the wine bar in front of my office (Di Vino) and for the upcoming December partying!</p>
<p>One route is to never do this again. Of course, that never works and there is more partying coming up.  The other one is to excercise&#8230; And just while I was thinking about this, in came Maria Pia with great news: she is starting Yoga classes at Santa Familia (Casco Viejo, Calle 4ta).</p>
<p>First class for free, she is planning to have the following schedule:</p>
<p>TUESDAYS &#8211; WEDNESDAYS &#8211; THURDAYS</p>
<p>10:30 a.m. / 12: 00 md / 3:30 p.m. / 5:00 p.m. / 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>SATURDAYS  8:00 a.m. / 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Here is the cost:</p>
<address>1 Class = $8</address>
<address>2 Classes= $15</address>
<address>4Classes = $28</address>
<address>6 Classes =$39</address>
<address>8 Classes = $48</address>
<p>﻿﻿Maria Pia is a certified Yoga instructor, and you can contact her at 6968-6040/ <a href="mailto:aramsana@hotmail.com">aramsana@hotmail.com</a> / Ph. 264-3795.</p>

<p>Panama Casco Antiguo For Sale, For Rent</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>December is on its way and <a title="Casco Viejo Developers" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, Panama`s colonial district is buzzing.  Developers are speeding up to take the most advantage of the sunny days ahead and beat the holidays coming up.  Several projects under construction will start delivering their apartments. Commercial spaces for sale remain scarce with only one (or maybe two) restored options in the entire colonial city.  Plan to invest a minimum of $550,000 for plaza front commercial space.  Keep reading as interesting investment opportunities are coming up in the Casco Viejo market!</p>
<p>Here is <a title="Arco Properties Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Arco Properties</a> short report on what`s going on today in Casco Viejo Real Estate world:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/img_7328.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2880" title="Cinta Costera Casco Viejo" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/img_7328.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a>Recently Inaugurated  (not finished): Cinta Costera<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The government recently inaugurated the extra traffic lines known as <a title="Cinta Costera Panama Fase 2" href="http://panamacascoviejo.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/" target="_blank">Cinta Costera Phase 2 </a>that arrives to Casco Viejo. Speedy entrance and exit, with a park along the water to jog and connect with the Cinta Costera along Balboa Avenue. Parking still under construction, the Cinta is already having positive effects on the businesses within the old city. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recently Finished Hotels (not for sale):</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/clementinas-cafe-entrance1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2881" title="Clementinas Cafe entrance" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/clementinas-cafe-entrance1.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a><a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://lasclementinas.com/" target="_blank">Las Clementinas Chambers and Cafe</a> (located at the corner of B Avenue and 11th) opened their doors last week and has been getting very good reviews. Classic &#8220;Old Panama&#8221; ambiance with a &#8220;je ne sais quoi&#8221; that some have defined as a New York feeling and some others as an European style.  Probably both being right, as Panama was always the crossing / meeting point for both sides of the Ocean.  Valet parking! <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recently Finished Buildings with Apartments For Sale:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Under Construction and Ready to Deliver Units in December &#8211; January:</strong></p>
<p>Although Christmas holidays and New Year might be the worst possible time for a developer to deliver units due to the endless holidays,  Casa Ruigar and Casa Garay are working at their best to deliver their products.</p>

The building has elevator and parking.  Some of the units for sale are already income producing, so if you are thinking on an investment level this might be a no brainer. Their one bedroom with water view roof terrace is for sale at $319,000 and their two bedroom apartment is on the market at $489,000 (199 mt2 on two levels). Their two bedroom with water view roof terrace is at $529,000, and income producing from day one.</p>
<p>Casa Garay on the other hand is built with more of a colonial style, since the building had a lot of calicanto (original stone) walls and historic features. Located at  10th Street, it is also in an area with a lot going on.</p>

<address>Real Estate and lifestyle at Panama`s Historic City</address>

</address>

<p>Last night we went to the launch of &#8220;Enlaces&#8221; at the National Theatre in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>.  Enlances is  Calicanto`s newest dance program for children of Casco Viejo. Their goal is to use dance as a tool to learn how to be better, how to grow and deal with their lives.  The program teaches a bit of everything: team work, self esteem, values, even helps them with formal school homework, but always under the fun cover of dance. The night started with a moving video where the kids defined the program in their own words, but beyond whatever they could say there was the bright star of hope and passion shinning in their eyes.</p>
<p>The main piece of the night was presented by Costa Rica`s dance Conservatory, a group that gathers young dancers (ages 15 to 24).   &#8220;O Pulpos&#8221; explored modern life, criticizing today`s fast pace and repetitiveness without thought, the fear of new things (or all things) and those who pretend to be afraid making a big fuss about it &#8230; but just to call attention.  A lot of black humor! just in case you might have thought dancers were a serious crowd.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Enlaces! if you are reading this and would like to contribute, please contact <a title="Fundacion Calicanto" href="http://fundacioncalicanto.org/blog/" target="_blank">Fundacion Calicanto</a> or Analida at Diablo Rosso (<a href="mailto:analida@diablorosso.com">analida@diablorosso.com)</a></p>

<address>Casco Antiguo Panama</address>
<address>Real Estate and Lifestyle in Panama`s Historic City</address>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casco Viejo, Panama`s <a title="UNESCO " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">UNESCO World Heritage colonial city</a> has slowly become the cultural heart of Panama. Artists and artistic souls gravitate towards Casco attracted by its authenticity and multiple textures.</p>
<p>And as summer approaches, <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> starts bubbling with small and big events, most of them un announces (or improvised!), but all of them wonderful.  Last weekend, walking by plaza Herrera, I saw the kids of the <a title="Fundacion Danilo Perez" href="http://www.fundaciondaniloperez.com/la-fundacion/" target="_blank">Fundación Danilo Perez</a> Jazz School playing at the Mano de Tigre plaza, surrounded by locals and visitors.  This Jazz School is the first art school to open doors at  the colonial city after Casco`s decline in the 60`s.  They take talented kids from the neighborhood and open for them the doors of a whole world through music. Many of them have been accepted at international music schools.</p>
<p>Now, a theater company has started a school as well. Located at 3rd Street and Central Avenue, next to the Ministry of Justice, there is a building with no logo nor sign. But  it is the headquarter of an independent theater company called <a title="Teatro Lagartija" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Teatro-Lagartija/16360067738" target="_blank">Teatro Lagartija</a>, a group that has been working underground for some years, presenting interesting works at unexpected places.</p>
<p>For 2011, La Prensa reported they are working on celebrating a Festival de Cocos (Coconut Festival) which would inaugurate officially their home in Casco Antiguo.  The festival will be held during the last weeks of January (right after <a title="Panama Jazz Festival " href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/english/" target="_blank">Panama Jazz Fest</a>) and the whole month of February. They are hoping to get theater directors to present either plays that were never presented or emblematic work of their careers.</p>
<p>Teatro Lagartija was founded in 2004. The play I remember the most is Panama for Dummies, which presented in a well weaved tapestry some of the most important aspects in politics and Panamanian &#8220;day to day&#8221; stuff in a small space using  smart dialogue and only plastic storage boxes as props. They used them to form buildings (while commenting on the real estate boom), buses (public transportation), a classroom (commenting on education), among others.</p>
<p>So keep your eyes open for Teatro Lagartija!</p>

<address>Casco Viejo Panama</address>
<address>Lifestyle and Real Estate at Panama`s Historic City</address>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christmas is coming&#8230; and the World becomes obsessed. And yes, I am one of them. But at least I do it responsibly!</p>
<p>The thing is that I always obsess about the Christmas tree. I want a tree, but don`t want it to pollute, etc.  Last year, I did a Christmas tree with newspaper and stuff found at the beach. This year, after a beach cleaning where<a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo`s</a> community participated, I got inspired to do it with plastic bottles. Also, I wanted to have my dog be part of my decoration, so I used the food bag as a door ornament.</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/cascp-viejo-eco-christmas-tree.jpg"><img title="Cascp Viejo eco christmas tree" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/cascp-viejo-eco-christmas-tree.jpg?w=225" alt="     " width="225" height="300" /></a>
</dt>
<dd>2010 Plastic Bottle Christmas Tree</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>This year, I got most of the material at Casco Viejo`s beach nearby the old Union Club and under <a title="Las Bovedas" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#Maps_and_Virtual_Tours/Las_Bovedas" target="_blank">Las Bovedas (outside the colonial stone wall)</a> .   I started hanging them, and here is the result so far! Haven`t used them all, I think I still have 45 bottles or so. I think those I`ll use as daily gifts for my dog, as she loves to flatten them. At the end, I`ll send the entire package (flat bottles and tree) to the recycling company that has started to collect material in Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>I call this an &#8220;ongoing&#8221; design&#8230; for sure it will be very different at the ends of the year! (yes, I tend to keep my tree until January&#8230; I know&#8230; separation anxiety).</p>

<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/clementinas-cafe-window1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2849" title="Clementinas Cafe Window" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/clementinas-cafe-window1.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>&#8220;Can you believe this is the street where your nonno lived for the first time when he moved from Ocú to Panama? &#8221; my dad was referring to his own dad, who per my Italian roots we always called Nonno (grandfather in Italian &#8211; you see, &#8220;abuelo&#8221; sounded too old&#8230; nonno was cool).   My ballet teacher was looking around and suddenly said: wao! this is next door to the old Dance School! I used to live right there, across this little plaza, but there used to be a kiosk there&#8230; now its gone. They used to play the lottery there on Sundays. I walked from my building two steps and I was already here, at my ballet school. The school was famous for its impeccable Spanish Dance troupe, and the small ballet group rehearsed at the back.  I remember looking at these gardens, incredible!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Where were we? at <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Clementinas Café,</a> at the corner of 11th and B Avenue, right next to the Police at Panama`s 300 year old colonial city known as <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>.   The secret gardens of the building had been a place where dreams flew for the young ballet dancer and many others. Now, they have been beautifully restored and are part of the cafe.  Stories didn´t end up there, as they discovered the history patched wall at the cafe´s back.  In a way, the cafe gave you the impression it had been there forever with its patched wood tables and old style bar.</p>
<p>The food takes elements of Panamanian cuisine (from both the Caribbean and the Pacific) and re interpret them into new &#8211; old combinations. The Caribbean classic &#8220;fufu&#8221; soup (in Bocas del Toro called &#8220;Rondon&#8221;) was re interpreted into an incredible coconut milk soup with chicken and shrimp.  This soup ( I love soups) was really, really good.  My favorite dessert was the &#8220;arroz con coco&#8221; (coconut rice) which had both rice and coconut, but don´t ask me what the chef did&#8230; it just tasted delicious. I stopped talking altogether and just slurped the thing down.</p>
<p>Although the Clementinas Hotel right above is already receiving guests, the Cafe opens officially tomorrow.  Outdoors and indoors seating, a great space for family brunch, small events or just a quick coffee.  If you are coming from Panama City and need parking, Clementinas has private  parking for you down the street !</p>
<p>Here are photos of the Café and the hotel rooms. Each suite is a full one bedroom with kitchen. Each room a bit different, with original antiques from the timeless elegance of &#8220;old&#8221; Panama.</p>

<p>New restaurant in<a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo</a>! Italian cuisine, La Forchetta took over former Antigua Restaurant. The re decorated everything and the menu features very good pizzas and risottos. Outdoor seating at the plaza and balconies. La Forcheta is a full building, so you can either have a cocktail at the bar below or seat (inside or balcony) at the first floor.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of spicy, try the Bocca di Fuoco pizza. But beware! even those who have had a pride of not &#8220;fearing&#8221; anything said this was really hot!</p>
<p>I`m lame, so I go with the risotto&#8230; Also tried the potato soup which had a nice citrus twist.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<address>Investment at Panama`s Historic City</address>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase two of Cinta Costera at<a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo</a> seems to be almost ready. The street  opened temporarily for the Patriot Parade this past weekend, which covered most of <a title="Catedral" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#Maps_and_Virtual_Tours/Plaza_de_la_Independencia" target="_blank">San Felipe</a> and ended up at Cinta Costera. Again, and just as we did on the previous Cinta along Balboa, we (Chispa and I) claimed the record of the first Casco Viejo dog to &#8220;inaugurate&#8221; the green areas properly.</p>

<dd>I did have a bag! but the Cinta had no garbage cans&#8230; classic. </dd>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are still working on the parking, which is now half underground instead of full underground. Also the Mercado de Mariscos area seems to be full speed ahead, building the space for the new pier. In the meantime, the old pier is still working, probably will be the last piece of the puzzle to move.</p>
<p>While a controversial project, there is no doubt that the Cinta Costera phase 2 will provide with an important support to this <a title="Casco viejo history" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">300 year old Colonial City</a> in terms of public parking and easy access.  While phase 3 is still on plans, it is being based on the construction of a  tunnel in order  to comply with UNESCO`s regulations.</p>
<p>These photos are from last Saturday and from the public bidding documents of the Ministry of Public Works.</p>

<address>Lifestyle and Real Estate at Panama`s Historic City</address>
<address>
</address>
<p>November is a crazy month at Panama, full of patriot days (which means tons of holidays!) and parades. The summary would include: Nov 3rd (separation from Colombia), 4th (Flag Day), 5th (Colòn`s Day / as in the City of Colón, not Columbus), 10th (Los Santos scream of Independence) and the 28th (our only &#8220;real&#8221; independence, from Spain).  This year, all the parades where at <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama`s UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. More exactly, under my balcony!  I could feel my heart shacking with the drums, and my poor dog didn´t know what was going on.  And there is so much to tell about these special dates!</p>
<p>Did you know Panama is probably one of the few countries in the World that managed to get 2 independences-separations without spilling a drop of blood? That says a lot for our nation and describes our non violent personality.   It was all a big negotiation, as we are a country with a privileged geographic position for trading and commerce.  Therefore, our heritage is diversity, a delicious Sunday soup where everything mixes to provide the best flavor and nutritious value!</p>
<p>If you don´t believe me &#8230; check these photos! they are from this past weekend (with exception of the diablico sucio).</p>

<p>We love seeing new corners and locales get activated! this is the corner next to Puerta de Tierra by Plaza Herrera, now with &#8220;Selina Embassy&#8221; a concept from the Selina hostels that serves as a window in Casco for all Selina hostels. It includes a store (everything a backpacker will need!) to a tour guide agency. From free weekly tours of Casco to day trips and more. Just call Pablo Cáceres at 6229-7350 to book one. Welcome!</p>

<p>I was buying a gift at the Canal Museum´s gift store and found amazing treasures. I learned that Panama´s oldest newspaper, La Estrella, has decided to re publish some of the news from early republic and before&#8230; way before. Found out that 1868 was a pretty tough year! the Isthmus was a wild place! But then, by 1904, articles included &#8220;20 Reasons to Invest in Panama&#8221;&#8230; I had to buy all the copies. For less than $3 an edition, you get an amazing potpourri of real history, news and adds that are to die for.</p>
<p>What did the &#8220;20 reasons&#8221; include? go buy the edition at the Canal Museum!</p>

<p>I love how Casco continues to transform properties that just a few years ago were considered &#8220;outside&#8221; of the &#8220;area&#8221;.  Casco continues to evolve, and now it is the turn for our version of the Five Points, meaning the five corners where Central and 11th street meet.  At this time, four out of five corners are active or will be activated in the next few months. This weekend, La Concordia, the most beautiful one opened. We went to celebrate Father´s day and to take a look! here are some photos.</p>
<p>Contact info: eva@la concordiapanama.com  Phone: 300-1125  Website: <a href="http://laconcordiapanama.com/">www.laconcordiapanama.com</a></p>
<p>The property has a groundfloor restaurant, 10 rooms and a rooftop terrace with a bar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>At Arco, we love books. The minute you get into our office, you´ll see them all around. Some people use books as conversation pieces, or as part of the decor. For us, it is far more, as each one has a story behind and a reason on why they are there. Many of them were written and produced by friends who live or lived in Casco, or are truly important references for Panama´s or Casco´s history and culture. To feature them all would be too long, but here are some of our favorites:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11996" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Blue-book-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>The Casco Viejo &#8220;must haves&#8221;:  UNESCO´s books on the architectural patrimony. The orange one was the first one. The green one refers more to the structure of the houses per se.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11997" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unesco-2-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11998" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Unesco1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>The Blue Book: Panama´s historic &#8220;phone directory&#8221;. It is fantastic, we are lucky enough to have an original.  Back when banks had a total capital of $700K and the add was personally signed by the (usually small) group of owners.  Back when pharmacies would sell you some alcoholic drink you trusted as medicine, side by side with soap and gun powder.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11996" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Blue-book-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Eadweard Muybridge: early photos of Panama, 1886, just in case we get too far with the &#8220;nostalgia for old times&#8221;.  Older doesn´t mean better! but it is a very graphic reminder of how far we´ve come as a country. Really interesting before the before photos of buildings in Casco.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11999" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/muybridge-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></p>
<p>Art history and art interventions:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12008" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballet-1-copia-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" />   <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12007" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/human-patrimony-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>The first one is about the history of dance and ballet in Panama, which happened to be born in San Felipe. The first national dance school was right next to Clementinas. The second book, Patrimonio Humano, was based on an important art project done years ago to highlight the importance of Casco´s mixed community. A group of artists put together life size posters with all sorts of people and scenes, and they &#8220;lived&#8221; hanging on balconies, doors and windows for a whole month, connecting people, architecture, history, and opening a space to discuss the future.</p>
<p>From our Casco neighbors:</p>
<p>Photographer Andrew Kaufman, artist Gemma Moore, and beloved neighbor and photographer Ken Milburn (R.I.P.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12001" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Isthmus-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12003" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/doors-of-casco-copia-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12004" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ken-Milburn-300x245.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="245" /></p>
<p>Writers: Carolijn Visser and Alberto Gualde (newest kid on our block!)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12005" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/visser-and-gualde-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>One of the many reasons I like Alberto´s book on Guillermo Sanchez Borbóns memories is because Tristán Solarte (as he used to sign his works) used to live in Casco. He has vivid memories of Bocas (where he was born) and Casco, specially Santa Ana. But he lived in San Felipe, near Calle 4ta (not on Casco´s side, but way on the other side).  My personal story here is that my grandmother and her sister, when they first came to Panama as kids to study (back then, they would send you quite young), they ended up renting a room in his house.  My grandmother loved poetry and herself was a very artistic lady.  Guillermo Sánchez Borbón ended up being one of the most important writers in Panama. His most famous book, El Ahogado (The Drowned) is part of the readings you have to go through in school nowadays.</p>
<p>So imagine my surprise (I was completely unaware at that time of this particular part of my family history) when I come home, asking my family to buy the book because I needed it for school.  The next day my aunt shows up with an old original, signed by the author himself.  My jaw dropped. I later learned the story.</p>
<p>To re read his memories of his life in this small town is, in a way, to imagine my aunt and grandmother roaming around Plaza Catedral in roller skates. Just as kids do today. Now they know to wear helmets, though!</p>

<p><a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_Panama" target="_blank">Panama </a>has changed a lot in this last 100 years of existence as a Republic.  <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> itself has changed a lot and as a product of this mix we now have a beautiful<a title="Unesco" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank"> World Heritage Site</a>.  To celebrate Casco Viejo`s roots (and therefore Panama´s roots) during these Patriot Holidays, I`m posting here different historic photos and a list of the most incredible street names you can ever imagine.  Most of the photos are from 1850`s from the photographer Eadweard Muldbridge, but there are also from other sources. And the street names are from Mr. Figueroa`s book on Panama`s history.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Calle de Matadero (today Calle 13, means the Butcher`s street)</p>
<p>Calle de las Damas (today Calle Colón, means Ladies street)</p>
<p>Calle de la Chancleta ( a name from 1812&#8230; not sure if we have a straight translation. It is the plastic sandal that you can buy for $0.99 at any store. )</p>
<p>Calle del Agua (Water Street)</p>
<p>Calle Salsipuedes (still exists! Get Out if You Can)</p>
<p>Callejón de Ahogapollos (DrownChickens Alley) &#8230;  my favorite!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big day tomorrow in <a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home#Home" target="_blank">Casco Viejo!</a> Big month, in fact.  November is known as <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_Panama" target="_blank">Panama´s</a> &#8220;vacation month&#8221; since it has tons of Patriot holidays.  After  Halloween (well, this is not a Patriot Holiday as you may have guessed) we have: Day of the Dead (or of All Saints) on November 2nd, celebration of our Separation from Colombia (Nov. 3rd), Flag Day (4th), Colon`s Day (5th), Los Santos Independence Scream (10th)and our Independence from Spain (28th).  Then  comes December with Children`s Day, Teacher`s Day, Mother`s Day, and of course Christmas. But one decoration at a time!</p>
<p>Like little ants, government workers are dressing up buildings, businesses are rushing through the last party permits and people squeeze themselves at Salsipuedes (Panama`s most famous bargain hall at Santa Ana in Casco Viejo) hoping to get the right size polleras, montunos and accessories for their children who are probably participating in a school parade during the holidays.  It was so tight at Salsipuedes that I could barely get my camera out! Literally &#8220;get out if you can&#8221;.</p>
<p>By the way&#8230; if you are in Casco, don`t miss the Zombie Walk! Everyone at Plaza Herrera at 9 p.m.</p>

<address>Casco Antiguo Panama</address>
<address>Nightlife and Real Estate at Panama`s Historic City</address>
<address> </address>
<p>Samhain is coming! Today known as Halloween, this celebration was originated in <a title="Samhain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain" target="_blank">Samhain</a>, the Celtic rite for  the passing from Autum to the darkness of Winter, where ancestors were honored and evil spirits were scared away by using costumes and masks. Quite an appropiate celebration (if you ask me) to be had at a 300 year old colonial town like<a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo</a> in Panama.</p>
<p>As you may imagine, since the fun part was to use costumes and masks,  today`s version is a bit &#8220;off&#8221; with the original meaning&#8230; but well!!! it is still tons and tons of fun. And in Casco Viejo, many are celebrating it this upcoming weekend.</p>
<p>Starting on Friday, newly opened Cafe St. Phillipe will have a special night with Bloody Mary`s (of course!) and a special Halloween Dinner. Call them at 228-0400, they are located next to Arco Properties at Calle 4ta and A Avenue.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casco-viejo-zombie-walk.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2776" title="Casco Viejo Zombie Walk" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casco-viejo-zombie-walk.jpg?w=225" alt="Zombie Walk Casco Viejo" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casco-viejo-zombie-walk.jpg 480w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casco-viejo-zombie-walk-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Saturday 30th and for the first time in Casco Viejo, Robbies`famous Zombie Walk and Concert by Filtro Medusa.  All dead people please present yourselves at Central Avenue and 10th. The event is completely free and tons of fun! The walk will cover most San Felipe, so you`ll have the opportunity to scare everyone.</p>
<p>The 30th is where most parties will be happening. There will be one in Central Avenue, by 7th Street. The add said: look for the smoke curtain.  Manuela at Caffe Per Due in Calle 2nda will have an early party.</p>
<p>Also Relic will have their big costume party! Last year was crazy, people really got into it. I saw anything and everything, and hope this year people overdo it again! <a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casco-viejo-halloween-party.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2777" title="Casco Viejo Halloween Party" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casco-viejo-halloween-party.jpg?w=225" alt="Casco Viejo Halloween Party" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casco-viejo-halloween-party.jpg 480w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casco-viejo-halloween-party-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>Sunday the 31st, Hotel Casco Antiguo (former Hotel Colon) at 11th Street will have their party as well.</p>
<p>I found this little Samhain poem and liked it:</p>
<p>A year of beauty. A year of plenty.<br />
A year of planting.  A year of harvest.<br />
A year of forests. A year of healing.<br />
A year of vision. A  year of passion.<br />
A year of rebirth. A year of rebirth.<br />
This year may we renew  the earth.</p>
<p>So whether you go Celtic or not&#8230; let`s celebrate!</p>

<p><a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo`s</a> unrestored buildings have a unique texture that have inspired artists from all field and nationalities. Last week, a fashion show was held at one of the largest fincas, along with a fashion flea market. The ambiance was fantastic, and the photography art show was excellent. Never thought I would finally see daring- straight forward-pretty-much-offensive- social criticism coming from a Panamanian, but it was great. Thumbs up for the organizers!!! got us thinking in different layers, and wanting more of these events in town.</p>

<address>Casco Antiguo, Panama</address>
<address>Lifestyle and Real Estate in Panama`s </address>
<address>Historic City</address>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never heard of turtles nesting in Panama City. My dad, who grew up in Calle 6ta San Felipe  and who never had a talent for surfing (or dangerous sports like my uncles who practiced a bit of everything including parachuting) always got the job of watching out for sharks (yes, sharks) and alert his friends who would be swimming or surfing at the point break (still existing) by Plaza Francia (Las Bovedas).  But never stories of turtles. After that, the city grew, modern Panama exploded, our bay got contaminated and only now the government has started to clean up.</p>
<p>Several months ago, while looking at old family photos, I saw one of him as a baby lying on a beach. The background had a fence with a palm and it was clearly a <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> fence, since I could recognize the style from an existing one here. But the beach was wide, the fence was a bit &#8220;off&#8221; and the palm&#8230; I couldn`t put it together.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0571-copy-copy.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2759" title="Turtle in Casco Viejo Panama" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0571-copy-copy.jpg?w=300" alt="Turtle at Casco Antiguo Panama" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/img_0571-copy-copy.jpg 803w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/img_0571-copy-copy-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>So this past Monday, at 11 p.m. a turtle showed up in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, without much announcement stayed there and laid her eggs.  She appeared at the beach nearby the Union Club to the surprise of Casco Viejo residents who managed to take this photo trying not to scare her away. Some reported turtles at Calle 5ta´s beach as well, on the same night.</p>
<p>No one has been able to put it together. Turtles nesting in Casco? we called turtle specialist from the Smithsonian, <a title="Argelis Ruiz STRI" href="http://www.stri.si.edu/english/about_stri/headline_news/news/article.php?id=454" target="_blank">Argelis Ruiz</a> and she was fascinated. &#8220;This is really interesting&#8221; she said this morning. &#8220;Normally you see them at undisturbed sites, but now &#8230; here?&#8221; She identified the turtle as a Lepidochelys Olivacea, a species that grows up to 100 pounds.  Casconians are very excited, and ngo`s such as <a title="Almanaque Azul" href="http://www.almanaqueazul.org/" target="_blank">Almanaque Azul</a> and AVACA are getting ready to implement a strategy to help protect the eggs.</p>
<p>But I could not get out of the shock, and suddenly everything seemed to have sense. My father`s photo, the turtle, the beach, the unrecognized palm.  After being in this business for a while, I think I`ve developed some sort of sixth sense for property and recognizing historic landmarks. They stay at the back of my mind until resolved.</p>
<p>I searched my Casco Viejo historic photos and found this one showing back in the days what is <a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/teatro-nacional-con-playa-adyacente.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2760" title="Teatro Nacional con playa adyacente" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/teatro-nacional-con-playa-adyacente.jpg?w=300" alt="National Theatre and Ministry of Justice" width="300" height="205" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/teatro-nacional-con-playa-adyacente.jpg 979w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/teatro-nacional-con-playa-adyacente-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>now the Ministry of Justice and National Theatre.  Next to it, there is (now) a big public parking (2 levels), obviously a modern construction.  But my historic photo showed something else: showed a beautiful green park.. and a fence. Of course! the beach extended all the way up there.  My father is over 60 years (he would kill me if I reveal exactly how much) and turtles live quite longer than that (over 100 years!).  Doesn´t popular knowledge says they always come back to their place of birth to lay eggs? there you go.  She most have found the neighborhood quite changed!</p>
<p>Hopefully, the oldest living Casconian will be able to visit us again and again in the future.  With a bit of luck and love, we will do what is within our power to ensure that she is able and will always be able to do so.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about AVACA is that it reflects Casco Viejo`s new community: its members are from all over the world:  Panama, USA, Australia, England, Italy, Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, Canada and Germany, a celebration of what Panama is, always was and really defines it the best: be diverse.</p>
<p>To all of AVACA`s members&#8230; happy birthday! and Congratulations!!! keep up the good work!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><address>Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</address>
<address>Panama Historic Real Estate</address>
<p>According to Martes Financiero (La Prensa&#8217;s financial magazine) Bocas del Toro and <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a> are Panama&#8217;s preferred locations that are being analyzed by Hollywood location scouters.</p>
<p>Although Panama&#8217;s film industry is still trying to get started, in 2008 Panama had the opportunity of being the main location for Quantum of Solace (James Bond). Now, productions featuring Salma Hayek (Our lady of the ballpark), Ben Kingsley (Vivaldi), Pierce Brosnan (The Vanilla Gorilla) , Kevin Costner (Learning Italian) and Al Pacino (Gone) are considering Panama as a location for their movies.</p>
<p>Martes Financiero pointed out that the few films made in the last few years reported an income for the country of 29 million dollars (according to numbers of Panama&#8217;s Film Association). Now, with six new projects on target, they are looking at a revenue of 106 million dollars.</p>
<p>From what I could experience from the filming of Quantum of Solace (since it all happened in front of my office), each film is a ton of work and coordination. I hope that with these new films, difficulties (such as the Migration office bureaucracy) are worked out.  Advantages to the country are many, as seen in other countries.</p>
<p>Now, would I get used to seeing celebrities walking down the street in Casco Viejo? Well&#8230; the funny thing about Casco is that nobody really notices. It is strange, but we saw this during Quantum.  Nobody took notice of anyone famous. There was Daniel Craig walking here and there, supporting actors and actresses going out at night&#8230; nothing.  The worst thing that can happen (and only if you are a good looking girl) is that men will whistle at you and call you mami.  If you are an actress thinking on filming in Panama and in Casco and are reading this&#8230; just remember: don&#8217;t take it personally. They whistle to everyone wearing a skirt or a tight pant. Or any pant, now that I think of it.  So just pass by, unless you want to make their day and smile waving back. They&#8217;ll go bananas!.</p>

<p>Last year, I made a Christmas tree with newspaper and trash collected from the beach.  This year, I got inspired at the last beach cleanup in <a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> by AVACA and decided to go with green plastic bottles.  So here they are! not yet a &#8220;before and after&#8221; but an inspirational photo.  I picked up a bit more than 110 bottles on Sunday morning, at the Club Union site and surrounding beach. Wao.</p>

<address>Lifestyle at Panama City`s Historic District</address>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning, while walking down to our <a title="Benedetti Hermanos" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#Ready_Now!" target="_blank">Benedetti Hermanos building</a>, I ran into this beautiful march. They where students from the Escuela Nicolás Pacheco and Escuela Estados Unidos in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> and they where marching against World Hunger, to celebrate locally the<a title="FAO " href="http://www.fao.org/" target="_blank"> FAO`s World </a>day against hunger.  Signs held by students said: &#8220;1000 millones de personas sufren de hambre crónica y eso me enfurece&#8221; (1000 million people suffer of cronic hunger and this enfuriates me).</p>
<p>Small awareness events like this shape little by little the minds of our youth. Congratulations to the teachers!</p>

During this time, COPA (Panama`s main and most successful airline) has broken every record for on time flights and service. Now, TACA and AVIANCA have allied with Aeroperlas, a local airline and will challenge COPA not only by opening more international flight frequencies but a new airport.... which is ten minutes away from Casco Viejo! ]]></description>

<p>Reaching pretty much any corner in the country by plane is an easy task if you base in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo,</a> Panama`s World Heritage Site, located ten minutes away from Albrook airport (a former US military airport) at the former Canal Zone.  And now, according to today`s note at Capital Financiero,  you`ll be able to easily reach international destinations through Albrook such as Costa Rica and South America.</p>
<p>Aeroperlas Regional/ TACA have decided to challenge COPA (Panama`s main and highly successful airline) and go for international flights.  They`ve already started acquiring their equipment: Cessna Grand Caravan and ATR 42/300.  Although their goal is to start operating these flights in 2011, their plans depend on getting international certifications and on having the government certify Albrook as an international airport, which would be an alternative to current Tocumen airport.</p>

A perfect blend of the right ingredients: beautiful secret gardens,  wood floors and even furniture made out of 100 year old wood taken out of the Gatun Lake,  tropical room style  (each one a full apartment with kitchen) and  stunning water and city views from the roof terrace.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see the changes &#8220;before and after&#8221;. For those of you who enjoy the process of revitalizing buildings, here are some interesting photos back in 2008 when it served as location for the shooting of El Viaje de Maria, a film by Tres Vagos Production.</p>

<address>Lifestyle and investment at Panama`s Historic City</address>

<p>Since<a title="ARco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank"> Casco Antiguo</a> (Panama`s UNESCO World Heritage Site) started its revitalization, most accommodations targeted high end or backpackers.  But now, we have an affordable and comfortable hotel in town! Hotel Casco Antiguo.</p>
<p>You might have known it as Hotel Colon, one of the oldest and probably the only hotel in Panama that has been operating non stop since the 50`s.  New administration and new approach,  the hotel has been remodeled into a comfortable budget hotel with unexpected water views.</p>
<p>The hotel has been renamed Hotel Casco Antiguo, which fits more its historic character. You might not notice it from the outside, but inside you`ll discover a Marrakesh style lobby (original) and the beautiful carved wood ceiling at the second level which are quite a trip to Panama`s past, when the country catched up with having chic &#8220;chinese style rooms&#8221; and arabian style tiles (basically the 30`s).  Casco`s only original elevator (still working!!!) is here!!! with only one big handle that either goes up or down (the type of elevator that has iron gate and brass).</p>
<p>Room prices:  $17 (single room, shared bath), $20 (single room, private bath), $17 (Double room, shared bath), $24 double room private bath), $47 (double room/ private bath, air conditioning, hot water).</p>
<p>The fee includes breakfast and WiFi. They have laundry services upon request.</p>
<p>Contact them at 228-8510 or hotelcascoantiguo@gmail.com</p>

		<description><![CDATA[What makes for a good property in Casco Viejo? as you know, Arco specializes in Casco Viejo real estate. So here are my personal thoughts about what makes for a good buy. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo Panama<br />
Panama Casco Antiguo<br />
Real Estate For Sale For Rent</p>
<p>From time to time I like drifting from my normal posts about Ocktoberfest and misc Casco-happenings (like the upcoming Zombie Walk, which I`ll post about later) to get more into &#8220;business&#8221;.</p>
<p>At <a title="Arco Properties" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_Arco" target="_blank">Arco Properties</a> we focus only in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, for which we are in touch with the majority of the projects and real estate products in this area.  Many of my clients walk in asking for guidance regarding what is the best buy in Casco at this moment, for which I thought it could be a good theme for a blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/calle-segunda-beach.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2697" title="Casco Viejo Real Estate" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/calle-segunda-beach.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/calle-segunda-beach.jpg 2592w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/calle-segunda-beach-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/calle-segunda-beach-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What makes for a good property in Casco Viejo? you want quality, space, amenities. Now, there are different versions of these three elements and it all depends on your budget and personal goals. Some ask for returns, regardless of the quality, space and amenities. Most Casconians appreciate quality, space and amenities more than short term returns because they have a long term focus and have seen the appreciation of real estate in this town, both compared to itself (since Casco started revitalizing) and compared to other historic cities in the region (such as Cartagena and San Juan).</p>
<p>So then again, what should you be looking for? remember some simple rules:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2698" style="width: 195px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casa-regina.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2698" title="Historic Fasade " src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casa-regina.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="195" height="260" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casa-regina.jpg 480w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casa-regina-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This property doesnt allow for parking</figcaption></figure>
<p>1. In Casco, what you see is what you get: facades can`t be modified, so if it doesn`t have the right space to fit a car, most likely there won´t be parking inside the building&#8230; ever.  Most buildings where built without cars in their minds, so chances are that if parking is important for you the number of buildings that can offer it is reduced.  Because of the space and historic preservation rules parking is valuable and extremely expensive to build.  When you buy parking, even if you think $20,000 a spot is too much, think about this: that parking could have been a commercial space that could have sold for over $3000 a mt2. Only to build it cost about $20K. So you are getting a super deal. And you will own the parking forever.</p>
<p>2. Elevators, pools &amp; extra stuff: buildings in Casco, like in most historic cities have limited spaces. Each one has a unique shape, a unique size. This is not copy n paste.  So amenities like elevator, pool, and storage are really rare and therefore valuable.</p>
<p>3. Location, location, location: the &#8220;best&#8221; location is in constant move right now. Why? because the Casco is a site that is being revitalized and there is still a lot of movement regarding where the &#8220;center&#8221; of action will be. Right now, the best projects are in Plaza Herrera, an unthinkable site back when Casco started restorations in 1997.  But this is where most hotels and restoration projects are being built. And will be the area most likely to benefit from the newly built Cinta Costera and new public parking.</p>
<p>4. Views: literally&#8230; what you see IS what you get. The UNESCO preservation rules protect heights, so most likely your view, whether is water view, garden or historic ruin&#8230; is protected.  Nobody is allowed to build a tower (surprise!!!) in front of you, ever.</p>
<p>Now, considering this&#8230; what is the best investment in Casco Viejo for this season?</p>
<p>I`ll give you 3 examples, on different price ranges:</p>
<p>1. Casco Viejo Investment under $300,000:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2699" style="width: 194px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0837.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2699" title="Casa Ruigar Casco Viejo " src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0837.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="194" height="258" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/img_0837.jpg 480w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/img_0837-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" /></a><br />
<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Your best buy at $269,000</figcaption></figure>
<p>At $269,000 you can get a 108 mt2 loft style apartment at <a title="Casa Ruigar" href="http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1pdml/CasaRuigarFullBrochu/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yudu.com%2Fitem%2Fdetails%2F227717%2FCasa-Ruigar-Full-Brochure" target="_blank">Casa Ruigar.</a><br />
Easy to keep, easy to manage, to rent&#8230; and the building has many of the amenities that make yourlife comfortable: elevator, parking (only 1 left! hurry up&#8230; ), and a common roof terrace with water views and a pool.  So Casa Ruigar is the best package if your budget is under $300K.  The unit comes with kitchen appliances. Location at Calle 4ta &amp; Avenida A, right in front of Arco Properties office.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2700" style="width: 261px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_3270.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2700" title="Common Roof Terrace with Water Views and Pool" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_3270.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="261" height="167" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Water View pool at Common Roof Terrace</figcaption></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casco Antiguo Investment under $450,000:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2701" style="width: 244px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/benedetti-casco-viejo-pool.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2701" title="Benedetti Casco Viejo pool" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/benedetti-casco-viejo-pool.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="244" height="183" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/benedetti-casco-viejo-pool.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/benedetti-casco-viejo-pool-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a><br />
<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yoga room, gardens, pool</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the $400- $500K range, your best buy right now is in Benedetti Hermanos. <a title="Benedetti 1C" href="http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1pdmb/Benedetti1CForSale$4/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yudu.com%2Fitem%2Fdetails%2F227710%2FBenedetti-1C-For-Sale--400-000" target="_blank">Specifically Unit 1C</a></p>
<p>which is for sale at $400,000. One level, two bedroom apartment at one of the most complete projects available in Casco.  Size 174 mt2. Because of its unique features and construction quality, matching Benedetti Hermanos will be very difficult in the future, so you can be sure that the value of your investment will hold long term. Benedetti Hermanos has a beautiful pool and gardens, and a yoga room. Storage, parking, elevator. Central air, central gas, weathershield (original) windows&#8230; the list goes on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. You want a building, not just one apartment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2705" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0427.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2705" title="Ph Isabella " src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0427.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/img_0427.jpg 480w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/img_0427-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">PH Isabella </figcaption></figure>
<p>Unless you are a developer, we don`t recommend to go for an unrestored building. It takes time, patience and funding.  If you still want a full building, there is one restored opportunity where you can buy the whole building for about $1M.  <a title="Ph Isabella" href="http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1jgb6/PHIsabellaDic2009/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yudu.com%2Fitem%2Fdetails%2F109228%2FP.H.-Isabella-Dic-2009%3Fedit_mode%3Don" target="_blank">PH Isabella</a> has 4 apartments (each one 2 bedrooms) and a commercial space. It also has parking, one for each unit. The building is income producing, as all apartments are rented. It is the first restored project at 9th street, a location with potential.</p>
<p>4. You are looking for commercial space&#8230;.</p>
<p>Hum&#8230; tricky one! very little on the market. If you are looking for commercial space, I would suggest to make offers on existing ones. It would highly depend on your goals. A plaza front commercial space (even if they consider to sale) wouldn`t be below $3200 per mt2.</p>

<p>Somehow this year Ocktoberfest was celebrated in September. I guess better weather in Germany! but since in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>we have tropical weather all year round, it didn`t matter. Ocktober is Ocktober!</p>
<p>So last night, Sajoscha at Callejon del Gato and Cafe Vienna (Calle 1era) celebrated with WeisBier (my favorite) and girls dressed with costumes.  Sajoscha himself dressed up for the occasion! Fun night&#8230;</p>

<figure id="attachment_2682" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casco-viejo-scout-troupe.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2682" title="Casco Viejo Scout troupe" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/casco-viejo-scout-troupe.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casco-viejo-scout-troupe.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/casco-viejo-scout-troupe-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Casco Viejo Scout Tropa 3</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you walk around San Felipe on a Saturday afternoon, anywhere around 1 p.m. you`ll see a group of 15 to 20 kids with Scouts uniforms roaming around with their &#8220;pack leader&#8221;.  The kids, anywhere from 6 years old or older (well, with some exceptions!) are all from <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>.  Through the <a title="Scouts Panama" href="http://www.scoutspanama.org/" target="_blank">Scouts </a>they learn team work and values through games and fun lessons. Each Saturday, they gather at <a title="Santa Familia Casco Viejo" href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=106&amp;Itemid=88" target="_blank">Santa Familia</a> in Calle 4ta and address issues that go from opening a bank account to discipline and family.</p>
<p>You would probably think, well, nothing extraordinary about that. But don`t take anything for granted. The Scouts work with kids that come from the poorest areas in Panama, some with extreme family issues and for the Casco they`ve helped break the cycle of violence by nurturing children with self esteem, values and fair play.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/waiting-to-be-a-scout.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2683" title="waiting to be a Scout" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/waiting-to-be-a-scout.jpg?w=300" alt="Never too young to be a Scout!

I have to say I was moved, to see them dancing, singing and enjoying themselves. But above all, I was impressed with the quality of the leaders who were true teachers, true parents.</p>
<p>Hats off to the Scouts!</p>

<p>Delicious strudels, cute little pastries&#8230; hummm&#8230;. Cafe Vienna just opened for the delight of <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/">Casco Viejo</a> residents and visitors.  I frankly could not recognize <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_Arco">Arco Properties</a> old office at Calle 1era and A Avenue, turned into this lovely cafe.  Kept looking for where my old desk used to be, but got distracted by the honey and almond pastries. I know, I have a sweet tooth. It is terrible. But it is so good&#8230;.</p>
<p>German owners Tina and Anuschka (mother and daughter) live above, so breakfast will be their specialty. It is also a great place to get your evening started, if you want to have a drink before going to the National Theatre (perfect for tomorrow! with La Traviata`s debut) or just to meet with friends before dinner (probably next door, at Callejon del Gato, owned by Sajoscha, Tina`s son).</p>
<p>Contact them at: 211-2513  info@elcafevienna.com</p>

<p>Agustin Clement and his partner Cesar Pereira became yesterday Panama`s first gay married couple.  The &#8220;big news&#8221; came out at La Prensa. According to the note, they didn`t do it under the law of Panama, but under the French (of course, one of the partners is French), as they signed the papers at the<a title="French Embassy" href="http://ambafrance-pa.org/spip.php?rubrique4" target="_blank"> French Embassy</a> located at <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, </a>Panama`s romantic 300 year old colonial city, a<a title="About Casco " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/nav#About_the_Casco" target="_blank"> UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997.</a></p>
<p>The couple signed what they call a &#8220;Pacs&#8221; for its name in Spanish which means something like a Civil Pact of concubinage and  Solidarity, which grants the couple some of the standard rights of marriage.</p>
<p>According to La Prensa`s interview to Catherine Peck, consul at the French Embassy and Casco Viejo resident it is not a marriage per se but a private contract celebrated among two consenting adults to organize their life in common.  Through the article they explain that this contract allows them to share material possessions and mutual help.</p>
<p>Somehow this explanation made sense for me, and it reminded me of a book I read a while ago &#8220;Cuentos Chinos&#8221; (Chinese Stories) where  a journalist interviewed an important Chinese Ministry  about China`s sudden economic boom and how it looked more like capitalism than communism. i don`t remember the exact words, but it went something like this: the journalist said to the ministry: &#8220;you know, in my country, if it looks like a cat and smells like a cat&#8230; it must be a cat&#8221;. And the Chinese ministry replied something in the lines of  &#8220;well, in China we have a similar saying: it doesn`t matter how it looks like or how it smells like&#8230; as long as it gets the mouse&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chinese wisdom! &#8230; only in Casco Viejo! love my neighborhood!</p>
<p>Inspired by this story and want to get married in Casco Viejo? From first hand experience I can tell you it is great! here are my picks for most romantic hotels in town<a title="Panama Canal House" href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/" target="_blank">: Canal House Panama</a>&#8230; and opening now!  <a title="Las Clementinas" href="http://www.conservatoriosa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=75" target="_blank">Las Clementinas</a>!</p>

<address>Panama</address>
<p>Check out this photo and see if you can recognize what`s going on&#8230;.</p>
<p>I`ve written about it before, but it is always fun to see how culture in Panama works. You pick up the paper and read about so many religious fights around the world. But the prove Panamanians are just happy go lucky about anything and everything is this photo. If you read my previous post about Panama`s Caribbean culture you would probably understand what you are seeing. For those who didn`t, well, basically the guy dressed in white with a white hat is a Babalao, a priest of<a title="Santeria" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa" target="_blank"> Santeria (</a>African religion that probably was made famous by Cubans&#8230; another similarity between<a title="Cuba Panama" href="http://panamacascoviejo.wordpress.com/cuba-plus-panama-a-powerful-combination/" target="_blank"> Cuba and Panama</a>).  Right behind him, a catholic priest from La Merced church. All the girls dressed in white with head covered in white are santeras.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/casco-viejo-la-merced.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2644" title="Casco Viejo La Merced" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/casco-viejo-la-merced.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/casco-viejo-la-merced.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/casco-viejo-la-merced-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why both there? because La Merced was the &#8220;front cover&#8221; back in the days for black slaves whose real deities where Obatala and other orishas from Santeria. In Panama, La Merced is also related as La Caridad del Cobre (Ochun). According to their tradition, Obatala was the first orisha created by Olodumare and represents the father-mother of humanity, who brings peace, harmony, creativity and justice. Ochun, on the other side, is the orisha of love, something of an Aphrodite with all her good and bad tempers.</p>
<p>And then you have the catholic side of it, which probably you are more familiar with.</p>
<p>What a sancocho! but well, such is Panama! I believe the sancocho (Panamanian chicken soup with a big mix of vegetables) responds to the fact that this country was always a mix of cultures and we had big waves of black populations coming either from colonial times (Africans) as slaves (mostly in Portobelo, you can still see the congos there), or Afroantillians which brought their own flavor to the pot. One of the reasons why we have a special &#8220;Panamanian&#8221; accent when we talk, and we dance similar to Cubans&#8230; and very different from, lets say, Costa Ricans&#8230; <a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/la-merced-casco-viejo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2645" title="La Merced Casco Viejo" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/la-merced-casco-viejo.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/la-merced-casco-viejo.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/la-merced-casco-viejo-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>(no offense! we are just different!)</p>
<p>And all this I could experience right out of my office in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>.  Nowhere else in Panama you are able to do this! Love this neighborhood&#8230;</p>

<p>Sunday, 8 a.m., San Felipe.  The 300 year old <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">UNESCO World Heritage city of Casco Viejo </a>is still half asleep but a group of neighbors, members of  Casco Viejo`s Neighborhood Association (AVACA)   gathered early near the National Theatre with a wonderful goal: to celebrate the Ocean`s Month with a beach cleaning, an activity organized simultaneously in other parts of Panama City by environmental ngo`s such as Fundacion Natura and Alianza Contaminacion Cero.</p>
<p>The  Casco Viejo target:  Santo Domingo`s beach, better known as Calle 3era.</p>
<p>Foreigners and locals  joined hands to pick up what ended up being a lot of garbage. At least over 600 plastic bottles, two bags of broken foam, ten bags of miscellaneous plastic items, two bags of shoes (brands?&#8230;well, that would be the next thing to point out in a beach cleaning!), one full bag of bottle caps, one bag of clothing and at least another ten bags of general garbage.  Between the most curious objects they counted one fire extinguisher, a bed frame and a plastic toy in the shape of a foot.</p>
<p>Sweaty from head to toe, the end result was amazing:  a clean beach to enjoy. Immediately, a softball game was in place, and children and adults ran everywhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>We where having cocktails the other night at <a title="Plaza Bolivar, Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/plazabolivar.aspx" target="_blank">Plaza Bolivar</a>, <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, enjoying the pleasant night under the stars when suddenly all hell broke loose.  But with rhythm and enthusiasm!</p>
<p>Of course, curiosity did kill the cat (died knowing?), so I had to go take a look. The street in front of the <a title="National Theatre Street" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/sanfranciscodeasis.aspx" target="_blank">National Theatre</a> was packed around a group of drum musicians from Korea.  I asked one of the people around me, &#8220;what is going on&#8221;? and he showed me his flyer &#8220;Binari&#8221; Korean Music. I have to say the powerful sound was overwhelming at the beginning, but after your ears got used to it, the energy it spread out was great! It had something of a carnival ambiance (especially with everyone in the street), and somehow I felt for a moment that maybe Asia and America where probably closer in their hearts than most would admit. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[Casco Viejo neighbor Danilo Perez is making history with his new album "Providence", which "talks" about his fatherhood experience. Danilo is not only a music genius, it is also a great inspiration to children of Casco Viejo. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>In Danilo`s words &#8220;“This record is based on the idea that whatever we do has an impact in the universe,” “The word ‘providence,’ for me, means standing up for the future of the next generation of children.”</p>
<p>And what a way to stand up. <a title="Danilo Perez" href="http://www.daniloperez.com/" target="_blank">Danilo Perez </a>and his wife Patricia Zarate are the soul and energy behind the <a title="Panama Jazz Festival Casco Viejo" href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/pty_6/index.html" target="_blank">Panama Jazz Festival</a>, an initiative that celebrated its 7th edition in 2010 and has raised the bar of the region both as a Festival but more importantly, as a music school.  The <a title="Danilo Perez Foundation" href="http://www.fundaciondaniloperez.com/fdphome.html" target="_blank">Danilo Perez Foundation </a>provides economically challenged children from the poorest neighborhoods in Panama with the opportunity of discovering music and being really good at it.  His students have reached international schools such as Berkley.</p>
<p>Their base is in <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama`s colonial quarte</a>r, once considered one of the poorest areas in the city and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site undergoing an interesting <a title="Casco Viejo " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/businesscasco.aspx" target="_blank">revitalization process</a> that has injected energy not only into architecture but into community as well.  The school, located at the old <a title="Conservatorio " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,828a4948-30fc-4f84-901c-b6fb011b5f02.aspx" target="_blank">Conservatorio building (Music Conservatory) </a>was a 10 year donation from a private developer that believes developing a historic city should not be separate from integrating the community to the opportunities that are being created.</p>
<p>When you first meet Danilo you sense the energy running through him. He is all about positive vibe. His family, his daughters are a clear inspiration. “What are you doing so we can have a healthy life in the future?” he imagined them asking. “What are you adults leaving us?”.</p>
<p>His efforts through the Fundacion Danilo Perez and now Providence are all trying to address musically or educationally those same questions.</p>
<p>Danilo has been acclaimed by jazz specialists and international press as a daring musician that goes where many don`t dare, over and over again.   His inspiration reaches wider and deeper than most think.  Seeing a kid from Chorrillo whose life was about survival now being able to stand in a plateau side by side young musicians from Europe and the States (and teaching others in  his barrio), you will be able to see and feel what Providence is all about.</p>
<p>Thumbs up Danilo and Patricia!!!!</p>

<p>Last night I was driving past Plaza Francia at <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/bovedas.aspx" target="_blank">Las Bovedas</a> and saw this sign in the middle of the park.  &#8220;Sara, Cásate Conmigo&#8221;&#8230; in English:  &#8220;Sara, Marry Me&#8221;.  I immediately thought of all those love declarations I`ve seen in the movies where someone pays to have it come up at the Super Bowl sign.  And then, the cameras point out to the couple and the surprised girl&#8230; would she accept?</p>
<p>Of course, in Casco we are far from having it so pinned down, but I thought it was quite romantic.  It was a &#8220;Casco &#8211; First&#8221; as far as I know.   I hope she did say yes!</p>

<p>August was a busy month for Casco Viejo! Two new restaurants opened: Beluga, a sushi bar at Calle 1era and Avenida A (PH Paseo Las Bovedas) and St. Phillipe Cafe, a small hangout at Calle 4ta (next to Arco Properties office).  While Beluga is more of a full restaurant with dinner hours, the Cafe is more of a light lunch (from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.).  They have an executive lunch and you can make your requests at 228-0400.  According to Ahmed and María Emilia, the café`s owners, they`ll be soon open also at night.</p>
<p>Welcome to Casco!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo<br />
Real Estate Investment at Panama`s<br />
Historic City</p>
<p>AVACA, Casco Antiguo`s neighborhood association celebrates its one year birthday this<br />
month. At its birth one year ago, the community identified five focus areas, being<br />
the garbage disposal one of them. Since then, the association has done different activities<br />
(from beach cleaning to educational workshops), many of them side by side with local<br />
authorities. However, the recollection system in the neighborhood was working only<br />
half way.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, AVACA`s Garbage Committee, the City (Municipio), along with Oficina del<br />
Casco Antiguo and the support of local politician José Blandón will inaugurate a new<br />
recollection system for the area. It is a first time for the neighborhood, as historically<br />
citizens and government had lived and worked in different spheres. But through AVACA,<br />
Casco`s community has been able to get organized and slowly lobby towards their goals,<br />
which is a very unique situation within Panama City. Only a handful of neighborhoods<br />
have organized, working associations.  Success depends completely on a full collaboration<br />
of both parties and continuity.</p>
<p>For Casco Antiguo, the first step has been to include local schools into the process.<br />
On Thursday, three schools will receive awards for a small art contest where children<br />
presented drawings of their vision for a clean Casco Viejo.  The winner drawing<br />
will be used as part of the campaign, which will include signs along the recollection<br />
trucks and fliers.</p>
<p>The event will also have a small theatre play where clowns and mimes will get the<br />
point across using what Panamanians and children love best: laughs.</p>
<p>The new recollection system will be simple: garbage will be collected at night.<br />
From 10 p.m. to 9 a.m. residential garbage, and then from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. a special<br />
car will come for commercial and restaurants. Garbage will be outside each building,<br />
and the use of bags is mandatory.</p>
<p>As simple as this sounds, it is a radical cultural change for the neighborhood, used<br />
to dispose garbage in any bag (and only if applicable) and at any hour. Education<br />
will be key to achieve this goal and for the next two weeks members of AVACA and Municipio<br />
will walk the area talking to every resident and handling educational material.</p>
<p>Another important element of the program is the coordination with local authorities<br />
to fine those who don`t comply with the new regulation. The Corregiduría will be able<br />
to process all the phone calls regarding improperly disposed garbage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know this is the beginning and we`ll need probably to make adjustments as we verify<br />
execution, but we can make of Casco Antiguo a roll model neighborhood. It is a small<br />
site, and we are excited about getting this project started.&#8221; said Eudes Quijada,<br />
area supervisor for Panama`s Garbage Department (DIMAUD).</p>
<p>Some of the local restaurants have started to recycle, which makes for an interesting<br />
second phase of the project.</p>

Beluga is open for dinner, maybe we can convince the owner to eventually open for lunch. See you there!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Leaving the office late one night last week I was surprised to find myself stepping out into the middle of a music video.  Some of our neighbors from Calle 4ta were shooting the video for Shadow’s new song, Dejalo Correr.  The song talks about violence and its consequences, a pertinent theme for the young men of Calle 4ta who, as former gang members, have the experience-based wisdom to speak about violence and its negative impact on the community with some authority.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Among the locals in the cast and crew were Titi, Nico, G. Ducret, Alvin, Sombra, Pichuli and Javier.  The guys seemed to be truly enjoying themselves pretending to be thieves, victims and opposing gang members; who knows, maybe we have some potential homegrown acting talent here in the Casco.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the music video, Nico says that they are working on starting another longer video that will also focus on the consequences of violence in the neighborhood.  To see former gang members dedicate themselves to these videos makes me proud to be a part of the Casco revitalization process.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:.1pt 0;">Is it a photo <span style="font-family:&amp;">or a painting?  That’s the question you’ll ask yourself as you turn the pages slowly in photographer Ken Milburn’s newest book, <em>Panama City’s Casco Viejo, Fast Rising Bohemian Community.</em> For fun, try guessing the actual location of the photos, some are easy, others will take awhile, and there will be one that will take an expert to figure out.  The majority of the photos were taken with a technique called HDR processing which expands the visible tonal range in a photographic image so it more closely resembles all the shades of brightness and color we are able to see with our eyes. </span><span style="font-family:&amp;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:.1pt 0;"><span style="font-family:&amp;">If you want to see a copy, contact Ken Milburn directly at <a href="mailto:ken.milburn@gmail.com"><span style="color:black;">ken.milburn@gmail.com</span></a>.  The next time I travel, I think I’ll slip my copy into the suitcase.  When friends ask to see where I live, watching their expressions as they turn the pages will say it all. Thanks Ken for capturing Casco Antiguo’s essence.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo<br />
Real Estate Investment</p>
<p>at Panama City´s Historic District</p>
<p>The Casco Antiguo Neighborhood and Friends Association (AVACA, for Asociación de Vecinos<br />
y Amigos del Casco Antiguo) is a neighborhood ngo that this month celebrates its first<br />
year.  For the first time, the community joined hands to work towards issues<br />
that development brings to upcoming barrios and to start gathering statistics of its<br />
growth.</p>
<p>Recently, El Casqueño published part of this information on a study made about the<br />
pace of development. Today, we´ll post some preliminary numbers on the growth of its<br />
internal economy.  Not a perfect count, but it provides with an important insight<br />
on Casco, which started its development in 1997 but it was only by 2005- 2006 when<br />
things started to gain momentum. Among the interesting facts are that during 2009,<br />
when things went slow because of the economic crisis, Casco Viejo entrepreneurs managed<br />
to open about 20 businesses as opposed to only 5 during the previous year.</p>
<p>Number of annual cultural festivals: 4 (Panama Jazz Fest, Music Fest, FAE Theater<br />
Fest, Dance Fest)<br />
Number of theaters/ cultural spaces in the Casco: 5<br />
Number of people attending Panama Jazz Fest: 20,000<br />
Number of music students attending Panama Jazz Fest: 830<br />
Number of existing accommodations (hotels, guest houses, youth hostals): 5<br />
Number of beds in Casco Viejo right now: 120 -130<br />
Number of hotels under construction 2010-2011: 6<br />
Number of hotels in plans post 2011: 3<br />
Number of rooms under construction 2010-2011: 254<br />
Cost of Construction:  to give you an idea, only Hotel Central reported their<br />
project was 20 million. They have about 140 rooms. Unofficial numbers point out that<br />
all 6 together (small and big projects) could be around 60 million.</p>
<p>Number of Commercial spaces (restored) and in use in 2009: 90<br />
Number of operating restaurants (San Felipe up to 11th Street): 27<br />
Number of commercial spaces under construction 2010: 13<br />
Number of commercial spaces that will be restaurants: 4<br />
Number of cruise ship passengers visiting Casco (Apr- Oct): 980<br />
Number of tourism- related websites that include photos of Casco in their content:<br />
9 out of 10</p>
<p>Number of ngo`s working in Casco Antiguo: 8<br />
Number of children, women and adolescents that are part of social programs of these<br />
8 ngo`s: 651</p>
<p>Number of restored apartments 2009: 266<br />
Number of apartments being delivered 2010: 43</p>
<p>Not bad for a historic district that is only 3 avenues and 15 streets&#8230; Casco Viejo<br />
is truly leading Panama as an economic engine and social revitalization that has its<br />
own power.  Its image is one of the favorite subjects of international reporters<br />
who find in Casco Viejo`s historic architecture and mixed community a wonderful story<br />
to tell&#8230; the story of true Panama and why people should come to explore it.</p>

At Panama´s Historic District</p>
<p>Fundación San Felipe is one of the oldest ngo`s working in Casco. Although you might<br />
not be aware of them, they are located at the San Felipe church and convent, corner<br />
of B Avenue and 4th Street, next to Hotel Colombia. Their major responsibility has<br />
been to restore and maintain the San Felipe Neri church (which is beautiful inside!)<br />
and run programs for children such as theater and even photography courses.</p>
<p>Every year, they hold an important art auction with Latin American painters, of course<br />
with a lot of Panamanian produced art. This year, the event will be held at the Marriott,<br />
on August 17th, 5:30 p.m. See info below!</p>

<p>It stood there, shinning bright, for about half hour (enough to brighten my workout!), and then left, with its promise of a pot full of gold and little green people with strange hats.</p>
<p>So that you don´t get too dissapointed with my bad photo, I´m including another rainbow (from last year) and more &#8220;rain &amp; beach&#8221; related photos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>This Sunday, Capital Financiero, one of Panama´s newspapers focused only in financial news published an interesting article about Panama´s economy recovering slowly.  After rising to a fantastic 10% annual a couple of years ago, compared only with China´s growth, it decreased to a 2 or 3%. During that time, many countries went below water, and we are grateful and lucky that Panama kept afloat based on the impulse of mega projects such as the Panama Canal expansion and the energy injection given by hundreds of Venezuelans who duirng that time made  Panama their home.</p>
<p>According to the note,  the monthly growth index (IMAE) shows in January a growth of  1.42% compared to the same period last year.  February went to a 2.24% and March looked great at 4.7%. The accumulated result for the first trimester seems to be 2.81%.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Finance, the GDP for the country on January was 3.9%, with was 0.6 percentual points ahead of the January 2009.</p>
<p>The country recently got a<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,235b0465-2dd1-4175-ad90-7d954f1804d2.aspx" target="_blank"> BBB investment rate from Fitch</a> agency and has targeted <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,07c0c991-f999-4aa3-8888-caa2f1e40b61.aspx" target="_blank">multinationals</a> to come and relocate their regional headquarters in the country.  If the published statistics are right, even tourism seems to have gone up,  increasing revenues from $395,6 million in 2009 to $401,6 millions in 2010.</p>
<p>After all these numbers my only thought is: let´s keep it moving, but let´s not shoot for the easy &#8220;going up&#8221;.  Organic seems to be the only sustainable way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>I can´t believe we are already on the 8th edition of the Panama Jazz Festival. This event, which is the brainchild of Panamanian Jazz legend <a title="Danilo Perez" href="http://www.daniloperez.com/" target="_blank">Danilo Perez </a>and his lovely wife Patricia Zarate,  has grown at an incredible rythm, not only in audience but in quality. It is already established as one of the most important Jazz Festivals in the region. But it is so much more than music. It is a platform to their<a title="Conservatorio Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,828a4948-30fc-4f84-901c-b6fb011b5f02.aspx" target="_blank"> educational programs </a>which open doors to kids of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in Panama to amazing institutions such as the <a href="http://www.berklee.edu/about/" target="_blank">Berklee College of Music.</a></p>
<p>This year, the festival will be dedicated to Panamanian Musician Vitin Paz and will be held from January 10th to the 15th.  Not sure who will be attending this year, but fantastic names like <a href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/pty_7/es/index.html" target="_blank">John Patitucci and Ellis Marsallis</a> have been already on the Fest stage, some more than once.</p>
<p>The festival usually has a wonderful closing with an outdoors concert at Casco Viejo, which this year will be held at Plaza Herrera instead of Plaza Cathedral.</p>
<p>Thumbs up to Danilo and Patricia!!!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The only way to ensure our future is through the education of our young heirs. At Panama´s 300 year old colonial quarter, this lesson found a new audience. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>Mud + trees + children = a lot of fun. That´s what Saturday was for Casco Antiguo´s community, as their neighborhood association <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,bab2f40b-bdb6-485a-b652-2e4600e76903.aspx" target="_blank">(AVACA) </a>celebrated the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,0def686a-b2ed-4f30-8ee7-53b995e96b01.aspx" target="_blank">International Environment Day</a>.  Together, they planted seven palms at the historic city and took the opportunity to teach kids about the environment while doing something fun.</p>
<p>The event, while it might have sounded simple and almost silly, was done in collaboration between ngo´s who work only at Panama´s historic district and it was an important educational moment for the children of the neighborhood which is often counted as one of the poorest in the country.</p>
<p>Since it was declared a <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> back in 1998, Casco Viejo has been gainning momentum. Its revitalization has recovered several buildings, but also the community has been experiencing change from every angle. NGO´s that are active have been funded almost completely by private companies and the new residents, which tend to have a commitment towards social responsability and have worked to open opportunities for locals by providing them with personal and professional education that could allow them to join the rise of the Casco.</p>
<p>Some of the most sucessful ones have targeted women and children. Even though the process has been quite organic, results are encouraging.  One of the programs run by <a href="http://fundacioncalicanto.org/blog/" target="_blank">Fundación Calicanto</a> has had 90% success in placing women under their hotel trainning program. Over 120 women have now stable jobs and families thanks to CAPTA.  On the other side of the spectrum, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,d93f3c76-c549-44b1-b0eb-72d60a08fe57.aspx" target="_blank">APROJUSAN</a> provides children with an afterschool program that has a basic but crucial goal: get them graduated from school. They follow up successfully more than 30 children and their families, providing them with everything for their studies including health checkups, meals and a psychologist.</p>
<p>These where the kids enjoying Saturday´s green event.  For them, it was an unforgettable experience. For the neighborhood, a milestone into a better community.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panama has always had a controversial relationship with the Canal. Today, Casco Viejo has taken a step to remember and connect!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>For many years, the Panama Canal has been the defining icon of Panama. It is also one of its main economic engines and one of the world´s top engineering treasures.  It was inaugurated in 1914 with the crossing of the<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/panama_gallery_09.shtml" target="_blank"> vapor Ancon</a>, although some quote that a French self-propelled ocean vessel called Alexandre the Valley crossed it a few days earlier.</p>
<p>As part of the terms negotiated, Panama gave the United States a large piece of land that would serve to place the military basis and  mega infrastructure needed to keep such an incredible venture. Many of the tropical forest that Panama has around the Canal nowadays are part of what they call the &#8220;watershed&#8221; which consists of large protected forests that provide with the water for the entire system.</p>
<p>In the year 2000 and as per a later treaty (the Torrijos Carter) the Canal was handled to the Panamanians along with the controversial &#8220;Canal Zone&#8221;.</p>
<p>While a lot has been written about it and in different tones, the truth is that it defined generations in both sides of the fence, as even Americans born in the Canal Zone area felt a bit Panamanian and created their own tropicalized culture that became known as the &#8220;zonian&#8221; culture.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo,</a> which back in the days was basically what was known as <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama City</a> but is now a colonial town that gained its <a title="About Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">UNESCO  World Heritage Site </a>in 1997 and  is being revitalized through private and government investment,   is home to the first official &#8220;zonian&#8221; memorabilia store in Panama.  It is located in the road between the two towns, as both connected through what is today Santa Ana and Chorrillo. It is also steps away from<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/santaana.aspx" target="_blank"> Santa Ana plaza</a>, which was known back in the day for the famous Cafe Coca Cola and the number of bars and nightlife. It is said that the performance shows in Santa Ana (and Plaza 5 de Mayo) where excellent, and that it was here where Peron met first Evita.  Who knows!  The store is small but big in significance for this upcoming colonial neighborhood.</p>

<p>For some time now, <a href="http://fundacioncalicanto.org/blog/" target="_blank">Fundacion Calicanto</a> at Casco Viejo (Panama) has been carrying out an experimental program at the colonial district. The goal, to effectively break the cycle of poverty. Their target: women. Their belief: by changin a woman, you change a family and affect a society.  The cost: $900 per woman.</p>
<p>The program has been running now effectively for about two years, and has graduated over a hundred women from Panama´s poorest areas including it´s colonial Quarter<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo</a> which is currently undergoing a revitalization process that has already positioned it as Panama City´s second tourism destination and cultural heart.</p>
<p>How is all of this happening? keep reading&#8230;</p>
<h1>Breaking the Cycle of Poverty in Panama&#8217;s Historic District Through  Hospitality Training</h1>
<p><em>A grass roots program in the impoverished historic district of Panama City  has a remarkable track record of turning around the lives of unemployed women  through hospitality industry training. The program, created by the non-profit  Fundacion Calicanto, graduated its sixth class on May 5, 2010 at the Panama  International Hotel School. </em></p>
<p>Panama City, Panama (<a href="http://www.prweb.com/">PRWEB</a>) May 10, 2010  &#8212; If history is any guide, one month from now at least 85% of the 16 currently  unemployed women who graduated today from Fundacion Calicanto’s “CAPTA” program  will be permanently employed in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The graduation, which took place today at the Panama International Hotel  School in Panama City’s Ciudad de Saber (<a title="www.panamahotelschool.org" href="http://www.panamahotelschool.org/" target="_blank">www.panamahotelschool.org</a>), was the sixth group to have gone  through the intense two-month program. To date, over 120 women have graduated,  and more than 85% of those women obtained permanent employment following  graduation.</p>
<p>The emotional ceremony was attended by the womens&#8217; families, program donors,  staff and dignitaries, including U.S. Ambassador Barbara J. Stephenson, who  praised the program for its effectiveness in empowering women, and spoke about  the role of women in breaking the cycle of poverty in developing countries.  <a title="CAPTA" href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/05/prweb3972274.htm" target="_blank">MORE </a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panama is tackling areas that have beautiful sustainable by products: education and opportunities.  ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Not sure if this was something planned, but sometimes it is even better when it sprouts organically.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a> has been for quite a while now, a banking hub for the region. Most recently, Panama´s main airline COPA expanded operations, turning the country into a fantastic hub for the America´s, which facilitated the relocation of multinationals into the country. The Panamanian government also paved the way for these companies to come in through tax exemptions and easier visa procedures.</p>
<p>So far, the country has received 36 multinationals. This year, the Panamanian Government seems to have a goal:  100 companies.  But it isn´t all.  Panama seems to be decided to be the center of main sport events as well.</p>
<p>Last month,the IX Juegos Centroamericanos where celebrated in Panama. The news now is that the country just won the hosting for the Juegos Bolivarianos for 2011.  Panama´s interest on sports is probably fueled by recent glories brought to the country by athletes such as Irving Saladino (who won gold medal in the Olympics) and Alonso Edward, a young Panamanian who got his silver medal but ran shoulder to shoulder with Usain Bolt at Berlin in 2009.  But probably it also responds to a multilateral tourism campaign thought to develop roots larger that just attracting people to events and to trade.  Both activities have a beautiful by- product: it creates educational and professional opportunities at interesting and  productive fields.  And particularly in sports, it seems Panamanians have always had an excellent track record, just to mention the most recent ones: from beisball stars Mariano Rivera and Tito Lee to boxing legend Roberto Duran.</p>
<p>Here is the list of the 36 multinationals already settled in Panama:</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble<br />
inelectra<br />
Sinopec<br />
LG Consulting<br />
Roche<br />
Caterpillar<br />
AIA Services<br />
Hyundai<br />
AES<br />
Total<br />
Volconsa<br />
Endress + Hauser<br />
Western Union<br />
Thunderbird<br />
Peugeot<br />
Halliburton<br />
Pan American Life<br />
Cemex<br />
Moffatt &amp; Nichol<br />
ABB<br />
J. Safra Asset<br />
Kumho<br />
Heineken<br />
Phillips<br />
BMW<br />
Genzyme<br />
Cargotec<br />
Nestle<br />
Hyosung<br />
Mars<br />
SAB Miller<br />
Otis<br />
Ericsson<br />
Adidas<br />
Sanofi Aventis.</p>
<p>Since 2007 several multinationals have moved their headquarters to Panama. The first one to break the ice was Maersk. Today, there are 36 multinational companies in the country and the government´s goal for December 2011 is to reach the 100.  See below the list of the first 36, although including Nestle is probably not fair as they´ve been in the country for many, many years.</p>
<p>But also, it isn´t just about the Multinationals who have come in to inject their energy into the economy. There is also an important group of International NGO´s that have moved to Ciudad del Saber, only 15 minutes away from Casco Viejo.  Institutions like United Nations (with all their different funds and regional offices) and UNICEF have made a mark in the economy.</p>
<p>Today´s Article at Capital Finaciero notes that the multinational executive is spending anywhere between $50,000 to $100,000 in Panama. From school to rentals, they´ve kept the market strong.  So far, they´ve calculated 700 executive families have moved to Panama. And the best is yet to come, as the works of expansion of the Panama Canal have not even started fully.</p>
<p>Here is the list of the 36 &#8220;new&#8221; kids on the block:</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble<br />
inelectra<br />
Sinopec<br />
LG Consulting<br />
Roche<br />
Caterpillar<br />
AIA Services<br />
Hyundai<br />

<p>Panama isn´t known for having an organized art season or opera or ballet season. Other than the National Concert Association, all other shows are privately organized.  However, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>has started to become a center of gravity for most art events in Panama and this month dancers have felt its pulling effect.</p>
<p>Last week, Panama´s National Ballet Company presented among other pieces Chopiniana at the<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/teatronacional.aspx" target="_blank"> National Theatre</a>, the entrance was free. This upcoming weekend, DanzaNova will be inaugurating their dance program with children of the neighborhood. The event will be on Sunday, at 6 p.m. at Galería San Felipe (Calle 2nda).</p>
<p>Then is the mega production of the Wizard of Oz, also by a Casconian and dancer (well, actually first dancer and then Casconian!) Analida Galindo. The production will have more than a 100 artists on stage and will be held at the National Theatre.</p>
<p>And finally, at the ends of May (I believe the 24th) the Argentinian Embassy will present a fantastic Tango and Piazolla performance where Astor Piazolla´s grandson will interpret his famous grandfather.</p>
<p>Waving the flag for other arts this month there is the art show by Cartooch at Espacio Panama (Galeria San Felipe) which will be showing throughout the month.</p>

<p>Many will have arguments against having dogs in apartments and closed spaces. The dogs need a backyard, and probably they are right. However, at <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama´s Colonial Quarter</a>,  I can say first hand that I´ve never seen happier dogs. The reasons are probably a combination of having great owners but also great spaces available right outside your door.</p>
<p>Let me explain: Casco Viejo is the only pedestrian town in Panama City. Not only this, but it has several areas that work as perfect dog parks which include a beach!  Check out the full list of workout places and relaxing <a title="Dog Parks in Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,adf26979-bb53-4925-8ac6-4e309d758e53.aspx" target="_blank">spaces for you and your dog HERE </a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Casco Viejo continues to surprise with every turn! find out what is cooking at Calle 4ta... ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>I always loved watching those TV series like The Sopranos or classic Italian mafia movies where the &#8220;fasade&#8221; business for their crime organizations was always a restaurant.   Seeing all those bullies having penne arrabiatta trying not to stain their  shirts while discussing who to &#8220;ice&#8221; was always fun. In <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama´s colonial district,</a> we have our very own &#8220;gang restaurant&#8221;!</p>
<p>Far from The Sopranos, the initiative is the result of a program where gangs re orient their lives and become entrepreneurs.  Experiment No.1 was a barbershop, which didn´t work out.  The girls within the group took over and created a <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,a11d5149-216d-4ddd-8e5d-36c2a2011140.aspx" target="_blank">wonderful Juice Bar </a>which has become the best fresh juice post in the Casco Viejo (and for a $1!!!).  Now,  they´ve grown and brought in the rest of the family.  The result is a restaurant called &#8220;Bohemios&#8221; which is really performing as a good neighborhood restaurant should.</p>
<p>Friendly ambiance, the staff is all family and friends (and bilingual!).  The chef has a great personality and will come out to chat, check out everything and make recommendations. The place is small,  only a few tables, but the ambiance is cozy and you are welcome to post your comments with a marker on the wall. If you feel like drawing art, you get beer for free!!! (as long as it is good art, though, no &#8220;stick cartoons&#8221; ).</p>
<p>Their gin and tonic is very good, and so are the samosas with mango sauce. Their best so far has been the chicken satay and the fish tacos. And yes, they do have &#8220;ice&#8221;&#8230; by the bucket, as you can order a bucket of beer!</p>
<p>The restaurant is located at Avenida A, between 4th and 5th. Open only for dinner (so far), but looking forward to expand to lunches.</p>

At Panama City</p>
<p>
The World Bank issued an interesting <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGEP2010/Resources/GEP2010-Full-Report.pdf">chart<br />
this week</a> featuring the growth pronostics for Latin America for 2010 and 2011.&nbsp;<br />
Their main message pointed out to a world wide recovering economy, even if still quite<br />
slow. On Latin America, their pronostics showed Panama among the leaders in the region,<br />
growing at a 2.7% in 2010 and probably a 3.8% for 2011.&nbsp; With major projects<br />
already under construction such as the Panama Canal Expansion, and most recently announced,<br />
a brand new public transportation system, Panama´s hands seem to be full for the next<br />
five years which will keep its economy moving.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[From learning Spanish to just having a fun but quiet afternoon, "Cinema Paradiso" has opened its doors! ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/citizen-casco-viejo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1086" title="Citizen Casco viejo" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/citizen-casco-viejo.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/citizen-casco-viejo.jpg 480w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/citizen-casco-viejo-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>I always joke about it, but the thing about the joke is that it has a big chunk of truth to it: I basically got most of my English watching Sesame Street and singing heavy metal songs.   In retrospective I should add: and going to the movies. Why? because I loved comparing the English words to the subtitles and catching translation errors. Also, the different accents where fascinating, along with the fact that &#8220;F&#8221; word got translated mostly as &#8220;carajo&#8221;, which I personally think is quite funny.</p>
<p>Not sure if <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> is ready for it´s first video store: Cinema Paradiso. But I´m sure everyone here will appreciate it! the collection is quite eclectic, but it will help the growing number of foreigners to practice their Spanish right at home while having fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/video-store-casco-viejo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1087" title="Video store casco viejo" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/video-store-casco-viejo.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/video-store-casco-viejo.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/video-store-casco-viejo-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>So welcome Rainer and Eyhaes! the video has also internet services and it is located in front of the Art Deco building, at A Avenue, between 4th and 5th.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panama is not known for its opera. However, things are changing quickly... and Casco Viejo is embracing them! ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dsc01551.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1081" title="National Theatre" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dsc01551.jpg?w=300" alt="Casco Viejo" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/dsc01551.jpg 640w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/dsc01551-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,5d136378-831b-4134-b293-e8c6cc336989.aspx" target="_blank">National Theatre</a> in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo (Panama)</a> was inaugurated back in 1908 with opera (Aida, not sure if they used the elefants or not!) . But curiously there wasn´t  an opera scene while I was growing up in Panama. And I grew up within the arts as I used to dance with <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,8179bf2e-2df9-4767-8d16-b122a1d8514a.aspx" target="_blank">Panama´s National Ballet</a>. I never saw opera. Not because my parents weren´t fans, as being Italian, my mother knew  all of Verdi´s operas by heart, and I have to say she sang it beautifully (while she thought no one was looking).</p>
<p>Then I have to assume most art shows where focused on orchestra, chamber orchestras, ballet, dance in all forms, painting&#8230; anything, but opera.  Maybe language was a problem? who knows.  I do have fond memories of my first (and only) opera experience while dancing.  I most have been 14 years old, and Armando Villamil worked with Maestro Ledezma in putting together Carmina Burana for Panama´s National Orchestra´s 50th anniversary.  They did it at Panama´s biggest theatre (Atlapa) and public didn´t fill out not even the platea. However, for those who went, they had a wonderful time.</p>
<p>For me, it was a fantastic experience, for the first time ever we had everyone who was anything in Panama participating. Choruses, modern dance, ballet, they pulled people out of the univesities, schools, every aficionado and professional they could get their hands on. And I´m not kidding.  They even had musclebuilders to carry Fortune into the stage.  I was so impressed by these colossus creatures painted in gold&#8230; well, excited about them until one came shyly to me and asked&#8230; &#8220;sorry miss&#8230; this play is beautiful&#8230; what is it? Cleopatra?&#8221;&#8230;. oh well&#8230; my first encounter with the &#8220;brains vs muscle&#8221; theory&#8230; at least they asked and where interested! somehow I´ve never been able to see a muscle builder the same since then.</p>
<p>But back to the story&#8230; Most people in countries where opera is an stablished art they would think as it as something normal. But in Panama, the movement has been built almost grassroots, like an underground thing.  Young guys, almost rebels waving the flag of opera like missionaries trying to get people to go.  And they´ve been succeeding! their passion is bearing fruit.</p>
<p>So here it is! for the first time since 1908&#8230; the first Opera Festival in Panama! and it had to be &#8211; of course- in Casco Viejo, where it all began, and where everything has a chance to reinvent itself.</p>
<p>Big note: the first 100 people to contact the association get free tickets!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,402781bb-10a9-4dcc-8bdf-bc5e83ee45dd.aspx" target="_blank">HERE IS THE INFO </a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>A friend called me: run to <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/plazaamador.aspx" target="_blank">Plaza Catedral!</a> the guayacanes are blooming!</p>
<p>I was in the middle of something stuck to my computer. But I knew the call was legit and the urgency of it: guayacanes bloom maybe twice (I would say once) a year in Panama and either you catch the moment or you don´t. They don´t last long, maybe three days, five the most.</p>
<p>I left everything on hold, grabbed my camera and ran down Calle 4ta. Tourists in the streets of <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a> thought I was a journalist or something.  Local knew better, I was in for something else&#8230;</p>
<p>The light wasn´t the best one, and I am no pro.  But I have a good camera!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Issues seem so big and complex. You are afraid that the sacrifices you make might or not be visible as a concrete, positive change. However, this is possible to achieve, in Panama. Keep reading. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><figure id="attachment_1070" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/junio-2009.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1070" title="CAPTA graduation 2009" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/junio-2009.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/junio-2009.jpg 1600w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/junio-2009-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/junio-2009-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fundacion Calicanto, Casco Antiguo</figcaption></figure>
<p>I´ve been following up the latest developments on the Health Care bill that got finally signed by Obama and couldn´t help but thinking: this is such a complex issue. In Panama, is complex too, but somehow you get a feeling that you can actually achieve something. I´m afraid that the States is so big and crowded that people can and do feel helpless.</p>
<p>While thinking about it, last night I attended <a title="Fundacion Calicanto" href="http://fundacioncalicanto.org/blog/" target="_blank">Fundación Calicanto´</a>s annual meeting in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo, Panama</a>.  It was an inspiring ocassion as we got to see the work of the Foundation on site: they are commited to breaking the cycle of poverty one woman at a time.  Well, actually twenty at a time. And their program not only works but costs  one time payment of $800 per woman.</p>
<p>No other fees needed, and it works. Results are immediate, concrete.  For each women changed, a family is changed.  Statistics show the family is usually anywhere between 4 to 5 members, sometimes more.  At the end of the program, they stand on their own feet.</p>
<p>The program started in Casco Viejo, Panama´s Colonial City but has now extended to poor areas of Panama City such as Curundu and Chorrillo.  Women entering the program go through an interview process. They tend to be single mothers (or with men that&#8230; frankly is just better to say they are single) and have between two and three kids, who are currently being raised &#8220;in the streets&#8221;.   Some of them have jobs paying about a $3 a day, most of them don´t have jobs.  Some of them have been victim of psycological abuse or even refugees.  But they are all united by a common spark: they want to get out.</p>
<p>CAPTA (Capacitacion para el Trabajo/ Trainning for Work) takes them into a full two to three months program that will train them into hospitality.  But it isn´t the regular classroom, where they get trained &#8220;for a job&#8221;.  In order to really pull these women out of poverty, CAPTA has had to dig deeper:  start with self esteem.  With theatre classes, art, how to take care of yourself, household management, micro finances, nutrition, best practices on health and sanitation. They even train them in CPR and emergency procedures, which has made many of them leaders in their neighborhoods as so many times they live in violent areas.</p>
<p>Only then, they start trainning &#8220;for the job&#8221;.  And it works.  The program has over 80% success, and so far has taken out of poverty &#8211; forever- more than 120 women.  Through them, with them, you take out of poverty and risk their children and husband (if he stays around!). Good husbands re gain respect for their spouses, children go back to school. Women get promoted. Hotels that have hired them report they are among their best employees from day one.</p>
<p>Even more, they stay friends among them. They create a network to help each other with their kids, they start being active in their communities.</p>
<p>During 2009, CAPTA<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,d7bc4e90-8150-475c-b538-79f79400d3ad.aspx" target="_blank"> graduated 40 women</a>. This year, the goal is to double the numbers.</p>
<p>A while ago I´ve interviewed <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,be76211b-ec85-4ca9-8315-ed8e1dc9f61f.aspx" target="_blank">Julia </a>who´s been working now for two years at the Canal House,  a hotel in Casco Antiguo who recently got a Green Award for their involvement in CAPTA (all their staff is CAPTA trainned), about her life and her goals, the impact of the program.  This is a woman who used to work for the government earning less than $5 a day collecting garbage at their sanitation department.  She used to be in survival mode. After CAPTA, her goals have changed. Now she would like to &#8220;learn English&#8221; and study.</p>
<p>While macro politics are needed &#8211; are crucial- I just have a spot for organizations like Fundacion Calicanto&#8230; who are actually getting things done.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Small, big, experimental or not, Casco Viejo seems a natural fit to sensible artistic souls.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>In the last few years, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo (Panama´s Colonial City) </a>has become the axis of most of Panama City´s art events. Small, big, experimental or not. From the annual<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,9e710aff-ca55-4803-b3c7-a956cfc432d0.aspx" target="_blank"> Panama Jazz Fest</a> organized by Fundacion Danilo Perez to last night´s Paraguayan Embassy music performance at the San Jose (Golden Altar) church, Casco Viejo seems a natural fit to sensible souls.</p>
<p>And now, the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,9270a5c9-3bf7-42ee-9535-bd682feba310.aspx" target="_blank">FAO Theatre Festival</a> is showing up. From March 17th to the 24th all scenarios available in Casco (National Theatre, Anita Villalaz and even LaCasona) will show plays from Colombia, Argentina, USA, Panama and more.</p>
<p>The only thing missing is coordination between all the theatres and organizers to post their events, as many of them are individually produced and there isn´t a known public forum to promote them correctly.  However, it makes it exciting for the residents of the area, who are able to enjoy these events as they walk by them.</p>

<p>A year and so of recession has passed and some investors have started to show signs of optimism. Depending on where you are in the globe, situations might have been a bit different.  What has happened in Latin America, and specifically in Panama and its micro- niche<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank"> Casco Antiguo</a>?</p>
<p>While most countries in Latin America (with a few exceptions such as Brazil and Chile) strugled, the effects of the recession in Panama where deep but not deadly, as the economy managed to keep afloat at a 3% (taking a dive from a 10% growth just the year before).  This year, Panamanian government has announced the country will grow close to the 4.5%. Several mega projects back up this statement: from the expansion of the Panama Canal to the recently announced Metro system which would transform Panama´s obsolete public transportation system.</p>
<p>Mega projects in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a> have usually been fertile soil for scams.  The <a href="http://www.pancanal.com/eng/index.html" target="_blank">Panama Canal Authority,</a> however, has been known to manage their administration with transparency and has been one of the few government related institutions that has kept a high level of trust from Panamanians and a sense of continuity.  Panama´s last administration completed the Cinta Costera, a mega project that in less time ever expected added six lines of traffic and a mega park along the coast line of Panama City formely known as Avenida Balboa.  Almost half year into it, the City seems to have changed its attitude towards social life, using the Cinta to excercise, chat, meet and cultural events.</p>
<p>Casco Viejo, Panama´s Colonial Quarter has been one of the areas that has felt the positive impact of this project.  Generally considered to be a difficult place to access due to its peninsula &#8211; shape, it is now more than ever considered an option for nightlife or residence. A second stage of the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,061828dd-18a0-4238-93ca-558b3963d2d7.aspx" target="_blank">Cinta Costera project </a>is extending the access to the historic city, making access and exit even smoother.</p>
<p>Still an undiscovered niche, Casco Viejo has been a bastion during 2009 difficult economic climate.  The site is currently undergoing a heavy restoration process: visiting its 300 year old streets you would think construction just didn´t  slow down.   The rental market during 2009, especially for commercial property, was stronger than ever. About 20 new businesses opened while only 5 did the year before. Hotel projects,  some of them controversial, have gone forward and in three more years it seems that this UNESCO World Heritage Site will have about 500 rooms, which will provide the right setting to increase foot traffic and value throughout the site.</p>
<p>The question remains, where and how to invest.  Casco Antiguo isn´t a fast return investment. There is a lifestyle component to it and a patience component as well. It isn´t for everyone.  As most historic cities, restoration takes time and value builds organically.  The same fundamentals that produce longtime value and avoid bubbles are the ones that will keep investments from tripling in a year.</p>
<p>However, the opportunity lies in Casco Antiguo now more than ever:  right before the hotels open.  Choosing from a residence or a commercial space will depend on the character of the investment. Commercial space tends to increase more in value as they are rare and well located, but it also depends on foot traffic. Residencial investment should be tied also to a lifestyle goal.  Some of them are being built <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,58ba1bc4-676c-48ff-9fdb-9904368f711d.aspx" target="_blank">with features that are unique</a> within historic cities.  Researching about them and knowing the contractors behind each project become essential.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Following up on my last post about Art Nightlife in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, Panama , here are the photos from last night! The night started with a BBQ at Super Gourmet (the hamburguers where the size of my face!) and from there people flowed freely to either Diablo Rosso or to JungleWood. The final parties where at Relic where the live painting and auction took place.  Art Block promises to grow into a monthly event, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/default.aspx" target="_blank">so keep an eye for it! </a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, Panama´s Colonial Quarter has a small growing nightlife scene that has been slowly been &#8220;taken&#8221; by art.   From some time now, there´s been &#8220;live paintings&#8221; at Relic one of Casco´s most popular bars which had included auctions. Now, the event is growing and some other bars and businesses are joining. Tonight! Art Block Party at Casco offers:</p>
<p>Diablo Rosso and JungleWood will open the night at 7 p.m. The Devils will be showing &#8220;Circa 10&#8221; and JungleWood will be showing a live sculpture demonstration, plus a small performance by the Brass Quintet.</p>
<p>Super Gourmet, almost in front of Diablo Rosso, will have BBQ and Wine until 9:30 p.m. (everything is walking distance, seconds away from each other) and then Relic ( a bit further down) will have live painting (and auction?) from 8:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. !</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Spanish had it figured out 300 years ago. Today, Casco Viejo seems to be learning from it and translating it well into modern lifestyle!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>You wouldn´t be able to tell from the outside, but <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a> &#8211; Panama´s Colonial City &#8211; is full of hidden gardens, small urban oasis that reveal themselves to the visitor, a tradition that has been alive for almost 300 years.</p>
<p>Back in 1673 when Casco Antiguo (also called Casco Viejo, also known as San Felipe for one of its main neighborhoods &#8211; <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-casco.aspx" target="_blank">see virtual tour here</a>) was first built by the Spanish, homes kept an European design: balconies, tall ceilings and interior gardens.  After nurturing from different influences according to each economic wave (the French Canal, the American Canal, the Gold Rush, each one bringing a new architectural style) the city fell into decay in the 70´s.   In 1998 it was designated a <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">World Heritage Site by UNESCO </a>and therefore the restoration began.</p>
<p>Today, fully restored buildings keep not only the patios that where originally there by the Spanish designs but also the apartments have now private roof terraces or even lateral and inside patios within the apartments themselves.</p>
<p>These have become small urban oasis where social live is happening: the community enjoys getting together, or even the intimacy of family life is enriched by them.  A simple principle well known to the Spanish 300 years ago.  Build a plaza with trees and people will come. Children will play, a community will gather, an important connection will be gained.</p>
<p>All of these being the true elements of a good lifestyle.  Somehow having these old, basic principles come to life has brought a new dimension to today´s modern living. And this reveals what Casco Viejo is all about: not  a museum style colonial city, but a real one, with real people injecting their energy and values to it.</p>

<p>Taking to an American friend the other day while having tea in <a title="Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>, I realized not everyone´s teeth are the same&#8230; nor the same cost. When she told me how much she paid to get hers cleanned and/ or worked out I almost freaked &#8230; girl! you could be partying in <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a> all through carnival with that kind of money!</p>
<p>This afternoon I´m visiting my dentist, which I´m proud to say is the only top of the line expense I have in my life. Well, the other one is my dog, I´ll do anything for my Chispa. And my husband. Humm&#8230; now that I think about it, I do have quite some expenses! no disclosure on who comes in first&#8230;</p>
<p>But seriously, cleaning my teeth with a US trainned Panamanian top on his career dentist is $60.  For fixing her teeth which had a hairline crack with great care was something close to $350.  In the States, she commented, this would be easily $1500. Maybe a $1000 since she could bargain a bit.  This equals some serious partying at Carnival &#8230; and still get your teeth worked out!</p>
<p>Seriously, think about it. <a title="Carnival" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,b5b6e4e3-1382-42e8-93f5-c8a2ffeca54f.aspx" target="_blank">Carnivals </a>are coming! starting on the 12th of February&#8230; where do you rather be?</p>

<p>Buyers continued to support properties that had strong fundamentals: uniqueness, location, water views if possible. It was a very active year for rentals, both on residential and commercial, but with a stronger commercial side. Almost every commercial space in Casco Viejo got rented, especially if it had the ability to have a kitchen, as almost 20 new businesses opened during 2009 countering a very few (around 5) from 2008. See the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/businesscasco.aspx">Casco Viejo Business Directory HERE</a></p>
<p>Both old and new businesses started to create a buzz on the local Panamanian market about Casco. More than ever, we´ve seen young Panamanians re discovering Casco Viejo, having a great time, and coming back with more friends. This marks a historic turning point of attitude that is injecting new energy to businesses and nightlife.</p>
<p>Another historic mark this year was&#8230; read <a title="Casco Viejo Panama " href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,1339eed8-6dc5-4b66-b200-92bb14d358e9.aspx" target="_blank">FULL STORY HERE</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/roy-gumpel-panama.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1008" title="Roy Gumpel Panama" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/roy-gumpel-panama.jpg?w=300" alt="Panama´s Hot Summer" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/roy-gumpel-panama.jpg 448w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/roy-gumpel-panama-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>While things get colder and colder at the north and south hemispheres, temperature in <a title="Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a> keeps rising to host the perfect summer. However, Panama isn’t all about white beaches and suntan, and don’t be fooled by its geographical location: Panama’s culture is closer to the Caribbean than to its Central American neighbors.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=337a006c-a65d-49be-b2ff-2d45468e4900&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.visitpanama.com%2f%3fid%3d%26lang%3den">Bocas del Toro</a> might be the best example of Afroantillian culture in Panama. If you can´t understand what they are saying, don´t worry check out some basic <a title="Panamanian words" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,30db5d0b-8657-4abc-b8f0-6d42f2975b5a.aspx" target="_blank">words here</a>.  Spanish doesn’t sound like Spanish, nor English like English, fish and music are equally spicy. Portobello, at the Caribbean coast of Panama into Colon province is another cultural taste, this time from the heart of Africa, as they are descendants of the slaves during the Spanish Colony.  Ask for the “plantintá” and be ready for “saus”.  Don’t ask too much about what is in there, we can just tell you it is not Kosher.</p>
<p>Colon claims to be the craddle of reggaeton. <a title="Reggaeton" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton" target="_blank">El General, Chicho Man</a> and other singers from this province form the basis of what later became commercialized with great success by Puerto  Rico.</p>
<p>A 180 degrees from Colon and Bocas del Toro are the Chiriquí and Azuero regions. Azuero is a wild peninsula with a deep Spanish heritage mixed with Indian. Here you´ll find the iconic polleras and jewelry that has made it into every “Panama” photo worldwide.  The pollera is said to be one of the most expensive traditional dresses in the world, weaved by hand by old ladies on their rocking chairs, it is a witness to the passing of the Spanish but also how they adapted to the luxury of the nature that surrounded them.</p>
<p>While Bocas del Toro is all white beaches, perfect blue waters, Chiriquí is all about mountains and the best coffee in the world. Literally, Geisha coffee cultivated at the Esmeralda Finca has been now the most expensive coffee by pound in the world.  Beautiful cloud forest extends through the mountains forming a bi lateral natural park with Costa Rica: La Amistad.</p>
<p>One of the seven living Indian cultures live in most of the park: the gnobe bugle. The other culture that has gained international recognition through its colorful molas is the Kunas, who live closer to the Colombian border into the Caribbean.</p>
<p>A trip to Panama is a journey of discovery and learning.  Everything is close and yet joined by the cosmopolitan international hub that is Panama City, which in itself host one of the most diverse historic colonial cities in the region: Casco Viejo.</p>
<p><a href="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/casco-viejo-panama.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1009" title="Casco Viejo Panama" src="http://panamacascoviejo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/casco-viejo-panama.jpg?w=200" alt="Casco Antiguo" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/casco-viejo-panama.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/casco-viejo-panama-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>In <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo (Casco Antiguo</a>, officially) everything meets. Spanish colonial architecture meets with Caribbean, French and Art Deco. Its <a title="Plazas in Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/plazabolivar.aspx" target="_blank">romantic plazas </a>host some of the best restaurants and bars of Panama City. Hotels in Panama tend to be cater to a wide audience, Casco Viejo is the favorite flavor of the adventurous soul with a taste for authenticity.  The <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=337a006c-a65d-49be-b2ff-2d45468e4900&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.intellicontact.com%2fp%2fglobnav%2fnewsletters%2fgreenglobecertification%2fposts%2ffirst-green-globe-certified-hotel-in-panama-the-canal-house">first certified green hotel </a>of the region, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=337a006c-a65d-49be-b2ff-2d45468e4900&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.canalhousepanama.com%2f">The Canal House</a>, is located in this historic town and has been featured by several publications including <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,2f3840ab-106b-4684-9824-88571e5f3957.aspx" target="_blank">Conde Nast</a> and the <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/ct.ashx?id=337a006c-a65d-49be-b2ff-2d45468e4900&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2ftravel.nytimes.com%2f2008%2f09%2f14%2ftravel%2f14surfacing.html">New York Times</a>. In the streets, Afroantillian descendants greet kunas and gnobes. Italians, French, Dutch, Americans and many other nationalities have made of this UNESCO World Heritage Site their home and you´ll see them walking and talking with different accents that remind of an early of Soho.</p>
<p>Some say Panama  is Hong Kong meeting Costa Rica.  Panama´s depth is there for the curious soul, but is also a place with a guilt free laid back culture that allows you to disconnect from the world if that is your choice. For sure, it is almost too much for a single vacation; Panama is a place to explore, enjoy, learn and to come back to.</p>

<p>I look around my neighborhood, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo,</a> and I see so many things that can be improved.  In 2009 we helped create a neighborhood association which is slowly getting to be heard on those issues. But I think nothing is as powerful as living the example, so hopefully this year will be all about &#8220;getting it done&#8221; other than &#8220;wishing it&#8221; only.</p>
<p>Not that my Christmas tree was a particular good example, but at least I didn´t get to buy one! and it is degradable for the most part&#8230; + made out of garbage I found at the beach.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Christmas can be the perfect time to put garbage to good use! get inspired... ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>It was an old friend of my brother who introduced me back in the early 90´s to newspaper wrapping and I never really drifted from it.  She made the most incredible designs with the newspaper and rope bows, which I´m still trying to go after.</p>
<p>Throughout the years I want to think I´ve &#8220;evolved&#8221; in my own little style. I pick through the year photos in the newspaper that catched my attention, especially if they define well a person I know. So for me, Christmas starts quite early!  I like it because it makes me think about my beloved ones all year through.</p>
<p>This year, I included a new element: the newspaper Christmas Tree.  I decorated it with garbage from the beach and light blue plastic bags.  My dog destroyed a pillow, so I got the cotton balls out and used them as well. Here is a photo of my <a title="Christmas tree" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,dd7b267a-6f53-49c8-8785-27775183d0d2.aspx" target="_blank">Christmas tree </a>on the works.   This week I´ll post the final &#8220;masterpiece&#8221;&#8230;.</p>
<p>Here are the wrappings that I thought where best&#8230; I hope it gets you inspired!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[New year resolution? How about kissing your cash away and being happy about it?  ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/casco-viejo-panama2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-992" title="Casco Viejo Panama" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/casco-viejo-panama2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/casco-viejo-panama2.jpg 1024w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/casco-viejo-panama2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>New year resolution? How about kissing your cash away and being happy about it?</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a great conversation with a surfer and his wife (who is also a real estate broker and investor) on why they travelled to Panama and where looking into buying a property in Casco Viejo.</p>
<p>They are from California and had visited <a title="Panama Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a> a long time ago. Now, they´ve seen the dramatic change the country has made since year 2000 when the <a title="Panama Canal" href="http://www.pancanal.com/eng/index.html" target="_blank">Panama Canal</a> reverted to Panamanian hands.  The country became a regional hub through <a title="COPA" href="http://www.copaair.com/sites/gs/en/pages/homepage.aspx" target="_blank">COPA</a> one of the best airlines in Central America and its ports system.</p>
<p>In the last year, they´ve felt inflation coming and have made a commitment to run away from cash before it vanishes.  Where to invest it seemed the million dollar question, literally.  Being real estate brokers,  their inclination was to go for hard assets that could resist heavy storms.  In order to be &#8220;weather proof&#8221; or at least less vulnerable, the hard asset would have to gather some special characteristics: be unique,  exist in limited numbers, have great location, have a protected environment, have enough stuff happening around it that would lift its value.</p>
<p>And therefore, <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> came to their minds.</p>
<p>As Panama´s historic city, Casco Viejo (called also Casco Antiguo) had everything they where looking for: a <a title="About Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">UNESCO World Heritage</a> site since 1998, it is forever protected from overdevelopment, not only by law but by an active community. There are only 700 buildings in the historic area,  each one with a special characteristic, a different architectural style that ranges from <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-casco.aspx" target="_blank">Spanish Colonial to French and Art Deco. </a></p>
<p>But also,  Casco Antiguo isn´t a dead museum type city. Only in the last year, twenty new businesses, between restaurants and offices had opened.  Casco´s only hotel  (<a title="Canal House Panama" href="http://www.canalhousepanama.com/" target="_blank">The Canal House Panama</a>) has already gained mentions in <a title="New York Times" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/travel/14surfacing.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> and Conde Nast, between others. This was the place where Daniel Craig stayed while filming his <a title="article" href="http://www.time.com/time/travel/article/0,31542,1881676,00.html" target="_blank">James Bond </a>movie  The Quantum of Solace. But its hospitality business is about to grow, as there are currently five hotels under construction.</p>
<p>With the Panama Canal expansion going full steam ahead and historic Casco Viejo gaining momentum, my surfer friends felt a wave coming and where ready to make a move.  They where ready to kiss their cash away and welcome 2010 with a smile.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Skaters in Panama are getting organized: their request is a proper skateboarding park... and their first activity was in Casco Viejo! ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Any given day you walk around 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. at Plaza Francia, <a title="Skaters in Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>(Panama´s old quarter) and you´ll see a number of young kids practicing skateboarding like crazy. In the same space (I don´t know how they manage) they also play football or street beisball. The kids really go at it, slamming themselves agains stairs, walls, floor. Standing up like nothing has happened, undusting and straight back at it.</p>
<p>They are yearning for a proper skateboard park. For this reason, artist and Casco Antiguo residents Cristine and Dom organized a party last night to gather funds and start lobbying for a designed skateboard park. It was a cheerful event! skaters from all ages where happy moving around the ruins of the old Club Union, going up and down ramps&#8230; fabulous!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The cheapest (best) beer is found in the middle of Panama´s Jungle]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>My Sunday started in Casco Viejo, Panama, at 7:30 a.m. when, after walking the dog and fixing our backpack we headed to Gamboa to catch the boat to go fishing in one of the world´s biggest artificial lakes.</p>
<p>Gatun lake is unbelievable. I´ve been visiting it for the last ten years, and I´ve enjoyed each trip.  It is an incredibly alive green emerald full of monkeys and species not even known to mankind yet (ask any Smithsonian scientist in Panama, they´ll tell you is a true mine).</p>
<p>In just five hours, we saw crazy monkeys, crocodriles, birds of all tastes, pelicans fishing in sweet waters? sure! why not.  And just when you think you´ve seen it all, a bar, in the middle of nowhere (one of the towns bordering the protected area), offers you the best frozen beer to cool you down from the hot, tropical weather.  Ten beers for $6.  What a day!</p>
<p>Back to my beloved home in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a> at 1 p.m&#8230;..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>For the past ten years, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a> has gone through a delicate process of revitalization which includes as many angles as a city can afford: urbanism, community, historical architecture protection, legal and so many more.</p>
<p>As it moves forward, it is very difficult to convey how much it has changed without an image bank that would be the witness of the recovery.</p>
<p>Looking through my archives, I found this image of Hotel Colombia from  1999,  now one of the most priced buildings and condos in Casco Antiguo.  Located at Plaza Bolivar, the building was one of the first restorations in the area.</p>

<a class="thumbnail img-thumbnail" href='http://arcoproperties.com/en/historic-renovations-casco-viejo-before-and-after/2000-hotel-colombia/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2000-hotel-colombia-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<a class="thumbnail img-thumbnail" href='http://arcoproperties.com/en/historic-renovations-casco-viejo-before-and-after/hotel-colombia-exterior/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/hotel-colombia-exterior-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<a class="thumbnail img-thumbnail" href='http://arcoproperties.com/en/historic-renovations-casco-viejo-before-and-after/dsc01106/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/dsc01106-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<a class="thumbnail img-thumbnail" href='http://arcoproperties.com/en/historic-renovations-casco-viejo-before-and-after/plaza-herrera-for-web/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plaza-herrera-for-web-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>

<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/dsc01106.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-965" title="DSC01106" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/dsc01106.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/dsc01106.jpg 1280w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/dsc01106-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/dsc01106-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Today, Hotel Colombia has parking and a beautiful roof terrace with a pool and a panoramic view that includes the bay of Panama and the modern city.  Several restaurants have opened on its groundfloor: Casablanca and Ciao Pescao. Soon a sushi corner will open its doors.</p>
<p>The same process that happened to Plaza Bolivar back in 2000 is happening now at Plaza Herrera where at least two hotels are being built, and businesses have started to sprout.</p>
<p><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plaza-herrera-for-web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-966" title="Plaza Herrera for web" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plaza-herrera-for-web.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plaza-herrera-for-web.jpg 448w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plaza-herrera-for-web-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Several high end projects are starting to deliver in the area, the largest one being <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/pre-construction.aspx" target="_blank">Benedetti Hermanos,</a> one of the few historic restorations in the entire district that has pool, underground parking, elevator, central air and central gas.</p>
<p>The government is also investing heavily in the area. This year, they´ve started to enhance the access area and combine it with green areas and parking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>If you ask anyone in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a>, they´ll tell you that the country is so much more than the Canal. And in fact, it is.  The Panama Canal represents a big income, some say about 20% of the country´s GDP.  But so is their banking center,growing tourism featuring upcoming unique sites like their colonial town of <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/investment.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo </a>and National Parks, and other industries that make for a balanced economy.</p>
<p>This month The Economist has dedicated an article to the Panama Canal and the impact of its expansion throughout this time of crisis. It is worth reading for anyone looking to invest in Panama or know more about it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The most refreshing thing about Cartooch is that it chooses to be critical but without cinicism. A daring position for an artist in a world where darker and bitter seems to equal depth and value. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Full of colors and optimism inaugurated the latest art show of <a href="http://www.cartooch.com/" target="_blank">Cartooch</a>, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a> (Panama) artists and residents, at the ruins of the former Union Club. Alegories of all sorts, some quite sexy! (photos not included&#8230;!).</p>
<p>Probably the most refreshing thing about their art is that when it chooses to be critical it does so without cinicism. A daring position for an artist, an edge where people could or not take them seriously.  Pieces related to being different within the society and how people are perceived from different points of view, resources abuse (energy), and freedom in general cruise through their work in an almost cheerful way.  Reminding us of our flaws, but also that it can all be overcome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>When I lived in Calle 3era<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank"> (Casco Viejo, Panama) </a>I remember this old lady on a rocking chair that spent her entire day rocking herself one way to the other, enjoying the breeze. Nothing would escape her eyes and her funny comments. If you needed to know where Pedro was, she could tell you in a second. Has your kid arrived? not yet. If the guy selling tamales passed by, she would scream to the guy and pull down a basket with the $0.25 to buy one.</p>
<p>Last night, as I was visiting a friend that lives in A Avenue and 4th, it was great to see how this traditional &#8220;balcony lifestyle&#8221; was so naturally taken by the young Casconians. We where having a small party for her parents, and with all the doors open, we where chatting with the neighbors of the building in front. Eventually, they stepped down and joinned us.</p>
<p>Balconeando!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>As hard as the MediCare  issue within the United States might be, it could be that offering off shore medical care could help balance the high coverage costs.  Currently, the government of Panama has been re doubling their efforts into getting their commercial trade agreement signed with the United States, including the extension of the medical benefit.</p>
<p>Countries like <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a>, where finding  US graduated doctors  is common, costs for operations are significantly less and where hospitals like John Hopkins backing up a high quality level, offer the best platform to extend the coverage.</p>
<p>Panama, is only 5 hours away from New York and less than 4 hours away from Miami.  According to Yanahir Diaz,  from the John Hopkins Medicine International there are several medical insurance plans that are already accepted in Panama such as Tricare, Vanbreda and Cigna.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Casco Viejo is one of this places where everything mix. Bohemian, authentic, slick and chic, everyone co exists and you would almost say it wouldn´t be the same without it.  From<a href="http://www.panamajazzfestival.com/pty_7/index.html" target="_blank"> Jazz Fest</a> to<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,d9570ca9-9ab0-4dfc-8a9b-7008cc7668d5.aspx" target="_blank"> Halloween</a>, from a thursday night out at Mojito´s grill playing trivia at an open garden surrounded by old calicanto stone walls that are at least 150 years old eating hamburger,  this neighborhood is just special.</p>
<p>Last night, everyone in <a title="Panama Casco Viejo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a> dressed up and went for a &#8220;chic&#8221; night out.  Starting with a fashion show at the Municipality (antigua <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/citibak.aspx" target="_blank">Casa Arias Feraud</a>) and later to a special sushi night at the Deli Gourmet.   The fashion show featured French designer <a href="http://www.fashionshowroom.com/fall2001/helenebreebaart/photos.htm" target="_blank">Helene Breebart </a>and Madeleine Cranfield from San Diego, California showed their best collections. Helene´s specialty is ethnic inspired clothing. For years, she´s been working with the kuna indians in Panama to create stylish clothing.  Latelly, I´ve even seen swimming suits with mola designs! Madeleine´s specialy is silk. She has beautiful and delicate creations inspired in nature. A great combination for these two artists, and Panama was their muse.  Later on, sushi night at Deli Gourmet. Chef and new Casco Viejo resident Sajoscha delighted guests with his creations. Soon, he´ll be opening a restaurant in Calle 1era&#8230;..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>When building a city, many elements are taking in consideration: healthy site, ventilation, strong foundations&#8230;whether in modern times or 500 years ago, common sense has ruled and succeeded. Elements that are common to the ancient Feng Shui knowledge.</p>
<p>Last week we had the visit of a Feng Shui expert in<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo, Panama</a>. She was amazed at how Casco Viejo felt like &#8220;good Feng Shui&#8221;. While this is not an official opinion, I believe there is some truth to it based on its historic foundation.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia  (  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui</a> ) I gathered that the term Feng Shui means “wind- water”.  One of the reasons Casco Viejo is where it is was because of it´s peninsula shape and rocky foundations. When the Spanish came to the point they had to move the city from Panama Viejo (because of the pirates attacks and the multiple diseases they got from having founded the city … in a swamp!) they looked for a place with crossed winds (to keep mosquitoes out) because it would ensure a healthier city and that was easier to defend.  The peninsula was the perfect fit. Therefore we are surrounded by water and crossed by winds.</p>
<p>I´m sure there would be endless amounts of common details that can be found in those cities that have succeeded and Feng Shui principles.  I thought this post might make you think a bit about it and maybe get her to do a full study!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The hair issue in Casco Antiguo... ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>As a full time resident of<a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank"> Casco Viejo</a>, and the type that never wants to leave the town (it is just so comfortable to be able to walk everywhere!) I know hair is an issue.</p>
<p>Your choices to cut your hair until a month ago where basically either calling someone that will come to your home or go full “gangsta” style, in which case you could have some incredible hair art carved on your military-shaved head. I´ve seen everything from a puma jumping a fence (would that apply for the “author’s right” ? ) to a lovely spider web on the head of a four year old kid who had a cute Spiderman T Shirt.  Creative as it is, somehow the problem is that it only works for boys…   We girls need special skills, you know.</p>
<p>So with great enthusiasm we are welcoming Chateau de Klipper, Casco Antiguo&#8217;s newest salon.  The owner, Susan Klipper, says that she will be offering fashion forward hair styling, coloring and highlights (her specialty), Brazilian Keratin, manicures, pedicures, waxing plus a range of massages. We already tried it and received compliments!  Chateau de Klipper is located on the planta baja in the recently restored P.H. Isabella on Calle 9 between Avenida B and Avenida Central, or what might be easiest: behind the Iglesia La Merced.</p>
<p>Until the official opening in November, Susan is taking clients by appointment.  See Casco Viejo<a title="Casco Viejo Directory" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/businesscasco.aspx" target="_blank"> What to Do Directory</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Teatro Amador is one of the cutest looking theatres of <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>.  A romantic fasade, has been awaiting for restoration for a while. Their owners, however, are starting to re activate the space&#8230; and what best ocassion than a big Halloween art show featuring original vintage porn posters from the 70´s and 80´s (and some earlier!) of another Casco Viejo icon: Teatro Variedades.</p>
<p>History of theatres in Casco Viejo is interesting. While the <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/plazabolivar.aspx" target="_blank">San Felipe</a> town had Teatro Nacional (National Theatre), Santa Ana which was a more popular area had Teatro Variedades. With the decline of the old quarter, both theatres (and later Teatro Amador itself) decayed to the point of showing movies (porn mostly) and even boxing matches.  Luckily, with Casco´s restoration they are slowly coming back to life. Today, th<a title="Teatro Nacional Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/teatronacional.aspx" target="_blank">e National Theatre i</a>s one of the most elegant theatres in Panama City. Teatro Variedades and Amador have been bought by developers and hopefully their time will come soon.   In the meantime, Teatro Amador will be an open space for interesting art shows and events.</p>
<p>Other Halloween events will be held by Relic (costume party) and Indigo Restaurant (sexy party!).</p>
<p>Where to go?</p>
<p>Teatro Amador: Avenida Central and 10th street. After the traffic light, follow the street towards Santa Ana Plaza. You´ll see it at your right.</p>
<p>Relic: 9th Street and B Avenue. At Luna´s Castle.</p>
<p>Indigo: Central Avenue, between 2nd and 3rd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Everyone talked about it, no one knew whether the project left behind by Martin Torrijos would be continued. However, Ricardo Martinelli´s Presidential term has actually started to go for it: extending the current Cinta Costera to <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/default.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Viejo</a>.</p>
<p>The project itself had been controversial. Many feared the design wouldn´t be in compliance with the UNESCO World Heritage regulations. However, the government seemed to have worked it out and had started to make the first movements in the area bringing materials to the site. Yesterday, the plans where made public.  The extention would add not only an easier connection through two new lines but also 120 underground parkings and a brand new multipurpose pier. An outdoors theatre, basketball fields and green areas.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Venezuelans have their eyes on Casco Antiguo, Panama]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>This year, <a title="Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo &#8211;</a> Panama´s colonial quarter &#8211; has seen the opening of at least <a title="business in Casco Antiguo" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/businesscasco.aspx" target="_blank">15 new businesses.</a> Not bad for a town of only 3 avenues and 15 streets. Out of those 15 (maybe 20 at this point) at least 5 are Venezuelan owned and operated.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-924" title="Aromas Café Casco Antiguo" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/aromas-cafe-casco-antiguo.jpg" alt="Aromas Café Casco Antiguo" width="336" height="448" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/aromas-cafe-casco-antiguo.jpg 336w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/aromas-cafe-casco-antiguo-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></p>
<p>Most of them food related, they are exploring actively to open new niches and inject their energy into the eclectic historic area.  Businesses range from informal cafés such as Tomato (soups, salads, wraps and breakfast) and Aromas Café, to Mexican food (Tequila´s Restaurant). Neighborhood hang outs like Mayal´s at 8th street and fusion cuisine at 9th street.</p>
<p>Other investors are looking into development opportunities and investment opportunities.  Their preference: to own commercial space either to rent or operate themselves. They view Casco Viejo as one of the areas that has the biggest potential in Panama City due to its historic and tourism character.  Regard it as something unique and authentic.</p>
<p>However, it is also a neighborhood in transition where  things take time and active involvement in community programs  is part of business life.  Not too long ago, <a title="AVACA" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,221ea166-dc6d-4331-aa1b-62dc011a0e08.aspx" target="_blank">AVACA,</a> the neighborhood association organized a <a title="Casco Viejo Beach Cleanup" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,ac5ec867-001a-41f5-9cc2-88bfd4fd2046.aspx" target="_blank">beach cleanup </a>with the community. Venezuelan restaurants, along with Italians, Panamanians, Americans, Brazilian, Colombian and many other nationalities helped raise funds for the event.  It was an enthusiastic day, enjoyed by all participants.</p>
<p>If nothing else, Casco Viejo seems to be the heart of what mixed neighborhood is all about, and is part of its attraction.  Not only old patina blends with restored buildings, and architectural styles are interesting, but nationalities and businesses are joined by a vision of building a quality brand called Casco Viejo.  Throughout its <a title="Panama History" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">history,</a> Panama has been the crossroad of the Americas, joining oceans and continents. And since 1673, Casco Viejo has welcomed every nationality to make a living.</p>
<p>With the right language and cultural backgrounds, Venezuelans seem to be set up for success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Way before the Sopranos, there was Giselle.</p>
<p>Panama´s National Ballet will be presenting one of the jewels of romantic ballet: Giselle at the <a title="National Theatre Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/teatronacional.aspx" target="_blank">National Theatre</a> at <a title="Casco Viejo Panama" href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx" target="_blank">Casco Antiguo</a>, <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a>, from October 5, 7th, 9th at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Basic plot: sweet girl in town falls in love with not so inocent Prince. He was supposed to get married with a princess. When she finds out, she dies of a heart attack (well&#8230; dies of love!). Leaves the prince feeling guilty and the guy who actually loved her (a boy from the town) heartbroken.</p>
<p>Second act: Giselle, as a ghost ends up under Myrtha´s reign. Her gang is made of all the women who have died of love and their mission is to take revenge by killing every man who enters their forest by making them dance until death.  When the poor guy who actually loved Giselle steps in, Myrtha´s army get hold of him and kill him. But when the prince comes in, Giselle arises. Myrtha orders her to dance with him and murder him, so she dances&#8230; but keeps a pace where he is still alive at dawn. Giselle has saved him and forgiven him.</p>
<p>The last scene, at dawn, he is found over the tomb of Giselle, repented.</p>
<p>It was said that when this ballet was first performed by Margot Fontayne and Rudolf Nureyev, the public was in such spell that they kept quite for a full minute after the curtain went down. And then, they couldn´t stop a 20 minute explosion of applause.</p>

<p><img src="content/binary/Giselle.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>Panama´s National Ballet will be presenting one of the jewels of romantic ballet:<br />
Giselle at the National Theatre this Wednesday October 5, 7th, 9th at 7 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Alexa Gutiérrez will be dancing the part of the evil Myrtha one night and as the sweet<br />
Giselle the other. She is usually my favorite when playing the bad girl. More than<br />
60 dancers on stage.</p>
<p>Basic plot: sweet girl in town falls in love with not so inocent Prince. He was supposed<br />
to get married with a princess. When she finds out, she dies of a heart attack (well&#8230;<br />
dies of love!). Leaves the prince feeling guilty and the guy who actually loved her<br />
(a boy from the town) heartbroken.</p>
<p>Second act: Giselle, as a ghost ends up under Myrtha´s reign. Her gang is made of<br />
all the women who have died of love and their mission is to take revenge by killing<br />
every man who enters their forest by making them dance until death.&nbsp; When the<br />
poor guy who actually loved Giselle steps in, Myrtha´s army get hold of him and kill<br />
him. But when the prince comes in, Giselle arises. Myrtha orders her to dance with<br />
him and murder him, so she dances&#8230; but keeps a pace where he is still alive at dawn.<br />
Giselle has saved him and forgiven him.</p>
<p>The last scene, at dawn, he is found over the tomb of Giselle, repented and crying.</p>
<p>And you thought ballet was boring!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; No way!!!! Don´t miss it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>I did exactly the opposite. I had dinner in <a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-panama.aspx" target="_blank">Panama</a>, took KLM´s direct flight to Amsterdam and had dutch pancakes the next day near Amsterdam Central station. It was so easy, I´m still shocked at it.</p>
<p>It made me think a lot about what people travel for and what they consider &#8220;exotic&#8221;. Being from Panama, for me, cold is an exotic destination. Examples of exotic animals include (and are not limited to): sheeps, furry cows (or furry anything), lambs. Interesting architecture features include chimneys.</p>
<p>So I thought to myself, isn´t this interesting. While I can take a plane at night and be in cold weather the next morning eating pancakes, anyone in Amsterdam can do the same and be on a boat at the Gatun lake in the afternoon <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc02xPXNn3k" target="_blank">watching monkeys </a>or hike at one of our 15 minute away national parks and stay that night in a World Heritage colonial city (<a href="http://www.arcoproperties.com/about-thecasco.aspx">Casco Viejo</a>) and have great dinner at a plaza that night.</p>
<p>Travelling before used to be this amazing journey for months on mule, horse, boat. And once there, wao, you had to work your way back. Now is so easy&#8230; just wait two hours in the airport, take a sleeping pill and wake up to your adventure the next morning!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Garbage is a problem of every city. While solutions can get as complex as full recycling programs with schedules, each program, as sophisticated as it might get starts always with a first step. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>For a while, garbage has been one of Casco Antiguo´s main challenges. The lack of education in the local community, along with the few resources of the City´s garbage department has been a negative combination. </p>
<p>During the last 10 years, Casco Antiguo has slowly gone through a revitalization process that has brought new people into the mix. This year, having a small critical mass of new residents, Casco Antiguo saw the birth of a community NGO called AVACA (the Casco Antiguo Friends and Residents Association, in Spanish) which has started to tackle the most important issues, garbage being in the top three. </p>
<p>This Sunday, the first public event of AVACA took place at Casco Antiguo. It was burning hot, but a cheerful crowd made it to the parking lot of the National Theatre, grabbed their tools and attacked the nearby beaches. </p>

<p>Casa Thai expands! now located at El Colegio, first floor, next to Casco Yoga , a few steps away from Plaza Herrera, just above the wine store Felipe Motta. Loved visiting them (my back needed it!) and came out a new person.  They have nice rooms for foot massage, thai massage, and the more classic massages like deep tissue and oil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo, San Felipe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind every project we do in Casco there is a story. So much love and effort goes into creating a concept and then a building in the historic district. But this is especially true for Santa Familia, just putting together the properties, the concept and the plans took us ten years. Imagine that!  I remember the day we got the building: even though it was in good shape (used to be a school), the best use it had at its time was as a paint ball field. For those who know Casco today, it might be hard to imagine it ten years ago. There was so much that was needed, and so much work to do. At that moment, we were engaged with a couple of NGO´s trying to figure out how to help them. And that is where we took a decision: we knew it would take some time to figure out the plans (never thought it would be that long!), so we decided that the building couldn´t sit empty, it would have a positive use. This became a policy in the company: everything should have a positive use, especially if not being used immediately for development.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13859" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0506-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0506-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0506-768x576.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0506-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-13895" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mural-Casco-Viejo-panama-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="249" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mural-Casco-Viejo-panama-224x300.jpg 224w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mural-Casco-Viejo-panama-768x1028.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mural-Casco-Viejo-panama-765x1024.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></p>
<p>So our “school” became a community center, a home base for many organizations that were (and are!) starting to make an impact in Casco.  For the first time they would be all together, and our hope was that they could grow and create synergies. And they did.</p>
<p>From the afterschool program APROJUSAN to the Scouts and the neighborhood association AVACA, to photographers, artists, environmental and art organizations.  For 5 years, AVACA ran the first recycling program in the neighborhood that allowed to gather data and knowledge on both commercial and residential garbage, and engage authorities, who are now starting to tackle recycling in the whole neighborhood.  It also served for years as the offices and classrooms for Calicanto´s CAPTA program, an empowering and training program for women in the neighborhood that today has already expanded its wings to different activities and areas.  We even had a little store called “Buenas Obras” where we created a currency (called Good Deeds) that could be exchanged for things at the store (that were mostly donated items).  We had a lot of fun. Asking Clara what was one of her most beloved memories, she said straight away: the dancing lessons with Luis Sierra! I had completely forgotten he had a dance group. She loved his lessons, and hearing all the activity of the other ngo´s around.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13855" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01163-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="178" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01163-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01163-768x576.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01163-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01163.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-13857" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aprojusan-apr-09-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="182" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aprojusan-apr-09-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aprojusan-apr-09.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /></p>
<p>But we also had tough times. Santa Familia served as a critical first response center to help neighbors that got affected by fires in the most vulnerable parts of town. Although very sad moments, they were also the strongest memories; having a place where neighbors would help each other re build their lives.  Santa Familia made it possible to have a logistics center where donations could be received and delivered from day one.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13917" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6318-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="194" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6318-300x224.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6318-768x574.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6318-1024x765.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-13911" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/repartiendo-300x208.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="193" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/repartiendo-300x208.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/repartiendo-768x533.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/repartiendo-1024x711.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></p>
<p>It also assisted in consolidating efforts when it came to defend our historic and natural patrimony, to save the beach and protect our UNESCO World Heritage Site, at the time affected by the construction of the marine highway, Cinta Costera 3.  Thanks to those efforts, we continue to have a beach we can enjoy, now also a nesting site for turtles and a wonderful city oasis for the community.</p>
<p>When we finally started to get ready to demolish the building, someone in the team asked “does anyone know how much stuff is in there”?  At this point we all had to laugh. I would say a lot. Both “stuff” and memories. Hundreds of lives improved.  Unpacking Santa Familia was a whole thing.  We created a big Patio Sale and donated all proceeds to Aprojusan.  It was awesome. And it was the right time and moment for it.</p>
<p>Now, we are embarking in a double adventure:  two sister projects that will raise the bar, each one in their own fields: Santa Familia and La Manzana. Fun fact: the original owners of both properties “way back when” where the same!</p>
<p><a href="https://info.conservatoriosa.com/la-manzana?utm_source=Inbound">La Manzana</a>, located right behind the Santa Ana Church, will now be a cultural hub where art schools, organizations and entrepreneurs will be able to own their spaces and become a permanent part of the community. It has even a 150 seat theatre!</p>
<p>And <a href="https://santafamiliapanama.com/">Santa Familia</a>, a development conceived around nature, community and wellness, will become the residential crown jewel of the historic district.</p>
<p>From our own experience as a full time resident in Casco, we can tell you one of the things that we most enjoy from living here is the connectedness your days and therefore your life can have if you chose to.  The ability to make a positive impact while enjoying every aspect of the community with a healthy, fun lifestyle. It is all here. Walking distance.</p>
<p><a href="https://santafamiliapanama.com/">Santa Familia</a> will make you re discover San Felipe, re discover the pleasure of being connected to nature and community in an intimate way.  <a href="https://info.conservatoriosa.com/la-manzana?utm_source=Inbound">La Manzana</a> will be where you go to go deep into our roots and experience the transformation through art into our future. We are excited, and hope you come join us!</p>
<p>Now, some photos of our most cherished memories! And if you´d like to know more about the history of the building, check out this article by <a href="https://impresa.prensa.com/vivir/herencia-hijas-San-Vicente_0_4151584860.html">La Prensa: article here.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div><p>Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo</p>
<p>Santa Ana is under construction. If we analyze the developments already being built in the historic area, we´ll find that the energy is being placed in the axis that goes from B Avenue all the way to the back of the Santa Ana Church, and then a second axis through 15th Street. Several groups are investing in different ways: restoring for commercial portfolios, or revitalizing residential areas with mixed use at affordable prices for first home owners.</p>
<p>Please note that Santa Ana is a large district, and that not everything is within the Casco Antiguo monument by UNESCO.  That is why we´ll be talking here about the Heritage portion of Santa Ana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13821" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mapa-investment-Santa-Ana-300x253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="253" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mapa-investment-Santa-Ana-300x253.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mapa-investment-Santa-Ana-768x647.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mapa-investment-Santa-Ana.jpg 785w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Darker circles: under construction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Commercial and Investment Development:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Mainly located around Plaza Santa Ana and towards B Avenue, we already see fully finished buildings in operations such as the Selina Hostel in B Avenue (awesome roof terrace with pool!), and under construction residential in the $250k range, at the Plaza´s side. There are also cultural projects in the planning and fundraising stage like the Variedades Theater.</p>
<p>Also, but towards Calle 13 and Cinta Costera, you´ll find La Cuadra, a residential project.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13823" src="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4158-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4158-300x225.jpg 300w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4158-768x576.jpg 768w, http://arcoproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4158-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Affordable Residential Cluster:</strong></p>
<p>Behind Plaza Santa Ana you´ll find a cluster of properties that are known as La Quince. This cluster is being developed by Grupo Conservatorio, our mother company, and is mixed use. Our vision: to revitalize the barrio offering the opportunity to people from the area, live or work, to buy their first home. This group of properties includes cultural projects such as La Manzana, with art schools, and even a 150 seat theatre. The apartments start at $85,000 and the banks that are financing first owners are La Hipotecaria, Caja de Ahorros and Banistmo.</p>
<p>The cluster includes the following properties, click on each one to see more:</p>

<p>Last week we had the pleasure of attending the pre inauguration of the International Film Festival Panama&#8230; at Casco´s beach! the night was wonderful, a spectacular night with Panama´s classic tropical breeze.

<p>Every year, Panama goes through a small spring that lasts a week or two. For me, Casco is one of the most romantic places to catch it, because the plazas bloom with beautiful pink flowers that fall like a small rain and carpet the floors.  So here are some of the photos I took last week at Plaza Catedral.</p>

<p>There was this craze the other night by Stranger´s Club: a beautiful cookie store opened. But not just any store, Royale Cookie Bar! Kids and adults with big smiles in their faces, injecting Nutella to their favorite (already huge size!) cookies. Our friend´s son ordered a milkshade, a classic dream of a milkshade with cream on top. But the best is to try the cookie injection! Not to be missed!</p>

<p>Another new kid on the block is Verde Limón, the new clothing store in Avenida B, near the ice cream shop Besos de Mi Negra. Great looking, casual clothing for our tropical weather!</p>
<p>The best? Both stores are pet friendly!</p>
