						<span class="text-description">Friday night was the official  opening for Benissimo Gelato &amp;amp; Caffe on the  corner of Avenida A and Calle 4.   After one taste, the coconut became an instant favorite. Bits of coconut are there down to the last lick.  Besides gelato, choose from their bacon mozzarella waffle or waffle with nutella con banano accompanied by  a cappuccino.  On Saturday, I dropped in for a panini de pavo as more than 100 assorted motorcycles roared through the Casco. Stop by, introduce yourself to Jose Manuel and his staff.

						<span class="text-description">Casco Viejo, Panama, Casco Antiguo
&amp;nbsp;
Last year, we had the pleasure of being at Las Clementinas for New Years. It was amazing, their rooftop terrace has almost a 360 degree view of Casco and Panama City. The city itself becomes your private firework show, from Paitilla to the Ghery Museum in Amador.
This year, Las Clementinas will open again its panoramic roof terrace.  Dinner will include a delicious menu featuring lobster and unlimited mimosas. It is the perfect spot if you don´t like crowds and prefer a more elegant, intimate ambiance.
By the way, the brunch the next day promises to be really yummy&amp;#8230; see the menu at the photos attached.
Call now!

						<h2><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/en/bienal-del-sur-casco-viejo/" target="_blank">Bienal del Sur Casco Viejo</a></h2>
						<span class="text-description">Panama Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo
&amp;nbsp;
I kind of dig the mystery and awe of bumping into good/ interesting art in the street. When I travel, I always look for those big or small corners of human expression, that space someone stole from a plaza or a wall and transformed it so that people passing by had a reaction, a thought, provoked a smiled or a protest. To throw at you a silent question, make you raise or low an eyebrow.  The Bienal in Casco Viejo has been so far a little bit like this. Today I&#x60;ll issue my small and humble review from someone who knows absolutely nothing about art.  So far, this is my favorite piece. It is at the Arco Chato, and it made me think about the connectivity we have as humans between each other, and the big floating pieces of adobe suddenly became a presence on its own, one very appropriate in a 300 year old colonial town that was built initially on those very materials. I think there was a story in the Popol Vuh that said that the gods have tried humans out of dirt first and that didn´t work out too well, so later they tried carving us on wood.  Since any of those creatures had much of a feeling, then they tried corn, which was sacred and therefore the legend comes out that we are the result from that final experiment. Seeing the iron/wood/adobe installation somehow reminded me of the materials we are all made of, which I hope was the point of the whole thing. Maybe I&#x60;m wrong!   Now, Popol Vuh aside, who is the artist? Silence. There is no sign, no explanation, recognition, big or small or even digital anywhere. Not even at the Biennale website. There is nothing easy to find about the great majority of the guest artists.
Was this mystery in itself part of the artistic happening? I doubt it. But I&#x60;m happy I bounced into this piece, I hope you like the photos I took.

						<h2><a href="http://arcoproperties.com/en/black-friday-casco-viejo-style-shopping-that-matters/" target="_blank">Black Friday Casco Viejo Style! Shopping that Matters</a></h2>
						<span class="text-description">Panama, Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo
Casco has really special retail, but our favorite ones are those who have an impact. Whether they benefit social causes like women empowerment and environment, or they promote young entrepreneurs with great design, truth is shopping in these stores will make your purchase benefit far beyond the person you are giving the gift to.  Most are located on A Avenue, between 3rd and 5th, which will make your experience fun and compact!
Starting at 3rd Street, next to Arco Chato:
Karavan: art from Panama´s Caribbean side and modern Guna indian designs.
Viviendo: One of my favorite places for gifts, not only because of the quality of their handcraft and design but because of the direct effect these sales make on the lives of really remote women who live in the mountains of Panama. Each purchase trully makes a difference. Dyes used come literally, from the jungle that surrounds their homes, browns from the clayish floor in those areas. Give a really special gift from the heart of Panama.
          
&amp;nbsp;
Lupa: A window into Panama´s young designers. A place to support young artists: clothing, accesories, art pieces.
 
Undercover Boots: Rainboots! each one with a different design, supporting a cause. For example, the Golden Frog boots support the Golden Frog project, an effort by the Smithsonian and a coalition of Panamanian and international scientists to save the Golden Frog, which is unique to this country and found no where else. They´ve done an amazing job building a sort of Noah´s Arc for them, and studying the fungus that is killing them. It is said that frogs are an indicator of global health: we need to protect them, and to understand them.
 
Mahalo: Café and store. They feature Panamanian gourmet products and natural soaps. Brands like El Motete are an effort from food producers to market their products directly.
 
Lido (Next to the Canal Museum): Casual wear and accesories from Bocas del Toro, our Caribbean province (next to Costa Rica).

No Me Olvides: If you are craving a Cuban style guayabera dress or shirt, this is the place to get it. Corner of A and 4th, right in front of Arco Properties.

Reprosa: Jewelry inspired on Pre Columbian Panamanian design.
